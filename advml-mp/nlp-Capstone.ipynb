While the rest of this notebook will assume you are using a list of dictionaries, you can complete it with dataframes, if you so desire. Some of the example code will need to be modified in this case.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## Building models\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first three questions, you will need to build and train an estimator to predict the star rating from the text of a review.  We recommend building a pipeline out of transformers and estimators provided by Scikit Learn.  You can decide whether these pipelines should take full review objects or just their text as input to the `fit()` and `predict()` methods, but it does pay to be consistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may find it useful to serialize the trained models to disk.  This will allow you to reload the models after restarting the notebook, without needing to retrain them.  We recommend using the [`dill` library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dill) for this (although the [`joblib` library](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html) also works).  Use\n",
    "```python\n",
    "dill.dump(estimator, open('estimator.dill', 'w'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "to serialize the object `estimator` to the file `estimator.dill`.  If you have trouble with this, try setting the `recurse=True` keyword args in the call of `dill.dump()`.  The estimator can be deserialized with\n",
    "```python\n",
    "estimator = dill.load(open('estimator.dill', 'r'))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You may run into trouble with the size of your models and Digital Ocean's memory limit. This is a major concern in real-world applications. Your production environment will likely not be that different from Digital Ocean and being able to deploy there is important. Think about what information the different stages of\n",

Instead of serializing the whole `GridSearchCV`, serialize just the estimator with the correct hyperparameters.  This can be accessed through the `.best_estimator_` attribute of the `GridSearchCV` object.  Alternatively, the `.best_params_` attribute gives the best values of the hyperparameters.\n",

If not, you will need to write a small wrapper function to mediate the data types.\n",

    "Build a linear model predicting the star rating based on the count of the words in each document (bag-of-words model).  Use a [CountVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer) or [HashingVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.HashingVectorizer) to produce a feature matrix giving the counts of each word in each review.  Feed this in to linear model, such as `Ridge` or `SGDRegressor`, to predict the number of stars from each review.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "1. Don't forget to use tokenization!  This is important for good performance but it is also the most expensive step.  Try vectorizing as a first initial step and then running grid-serach and cross-validation only on of this pre-processed data.  `CountVectorizer` has to memorize the mapping between words and the index to which it is assigned.  This is linear in the size of the vocabulary.  The `HashingVectorizer` does not have to remember this mapping and will lead to much smaller models.\n",
    "\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\n",
    "\n",
    " text = [row['text'] for row in data]\n",
    " X = CountVectorizer().fit_transform(text)\n",

    " # without needing to retrain the vectorizer:\n",
    " model.fit(X, stars, hyperparameter=something)\n",
    " ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Try choosing different values for `min_df` (minimum document frequency cutoff) and `max_df` in `CountVectorizer`.  Setting `min_df` to zero admits rare words which might only appear once in the entire corpus.  This is both prone to overfitting and makes your data unmanageably large.  Don't forget to use cross-validation or to select the right value.  Notice that `HashingVectorizer` doesn't support `min_df`  and `max_df`.  However, it's not hard to roll your own transformer that solves for these.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try using [LinearRegression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression) or [RidgeCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV.html#sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV).  If the memory footprint is too big, try switching to [Stochastic Gradient Descent](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html#sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor) You might find that even ordinary linear regression fails due to the data size.  Don't forget to use [GridSearchCV](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV.html#sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV) to determine the regularization parameter!  How do the regularization parameter `alpha` and the values of `min_df` and `max_df` from `CountVectorizer` change the answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You will likely pick up several hyperparameters between the tokenization step and the regularization of the estimator.  While is is more strictly correct to do a grid search over all of them at once, this can take a long time. Quite often, doing a grid search over a single hyperparameter at a time can produce similar results.  Alternatively, the grid search may be done over a smaller subset of the data, as long as it is representative of the whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finally, assemble a pipeline that will transform the data from records all the way to predictions.  This will allow you to submit its predict method to the grader for scoring."

    "Sometimes, reducing the dimension can be useful.  Because we are dealing with a sparse matrix, we have to use [TruncatedSVD](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD.html#sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD).  If we reduce the dimensions, we can use a more sophisticated models than linear ones.\n",

Playing with the number of features, using the `HashingVectorizer`, incorporating `min_df` and `max_df` limits, and handling stop-words in some way are all methods of addressing this issue. If you are using `CountVectorizer`, it is possible to run it with a fixed vocabulary (based on a training run, for instance). Check the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A side note on multi-stage model evaluation:** When your model consists of a pipeline with several stages, it can be worthwhile to evaluate which parts of the pipeline have the greatest impact on the overall accuracy (or other metric) of the model. This allows you to focus your efforts on improving the important algorithms, and leaving the rest \"good enough\".\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to accomplish this is through ceiling analysis, which can be useful when you have a training set with ground truth values at each stage. Let's say you're training a model to extract image captions from websites and return a list of names that were in the caption. Your overall accuracy at some point reaches 70%. You can try manually giving the model what you know are the correct image captions from the training set, and see how the accuracy improves (maybe up to 75%). Alternatively, giving the model the perfect name parsing for each caption increases accuracy to 90%. This indicates that the name parsing is a much more promising target for further work, and the caption extraction is a relatively smaller factor in the overall performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know the right answers at different stages of the pipeline, you can still evaluate how important different parts of the model are to its performance by changing or removing certain steps while keeping everything else constant. You might try this kind of analysis to determine how important adding stopwords and stemming to your NLP model actually is, and how that importance changes with parameters like the number of features."

Mathematically, if $p(w)$ be the probability of a word $w$ and $p(w_1 w_2)$ is the probability of the bigram $w_1 w_2$, then we want to look at word pairs $w_1 w_2$ where the statistic\n",
    "\n",
    "  $$ \\frac{p(w_1 w_2)}{p(w_1) p(w_2)} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "is high.  Return the top 100 (mostly food) bigrams with this statistic with the 'right' prior factor (see below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Estimating the probabilities is simply a matter of counting, and there are number of approaches that will work.  One is to use one of the tokenizers to count up how many times each word and each bigram appears in each review, and then sum those up over all reviews.  You might want to know that te `CountVectorizer` has a `.get_feature_names()` method which gives the string associated with each column.  (Question for thought: Why doesn't the `HashingVectorizer` have a similar method?)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Questions:* This statistic is a ratio and problematic when the denominator is small.  We can fix this by applying Bayesian smoothing to $p(w)$ (i.e. mixing the empirical distribution with the uniform distribution over the vocabulary).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How does changing this smoothing parameter affect the word pairs you get qualitatively?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We can interpret the smoothing parameter as adding a constant number of occurrences of each word to our distribution.  Does this help you determine set a reasonable value for this 'prior factor'?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For fun: also check out [Amazon's Statistically Improbable Phrases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistically_Improbable_Phrases).\n",
    "\n",
    "*Implementation note:*\n",
    "As you adjust the size of the Bayesian smoothing parameter, you will notice first nonsense phrases being removed and then legitimate bigrams being removed, leaving you with only generic bigrams.  The goal is to find a value of the smoothing parameter between these two transitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reference solution is not an aggressive filterer: it errors in favor of leaving apparently nonsensical words. On further consideration, many of these are actually somewhat meaningful. The smoothing parameter chosen in the reference solution is equivalent to giving each word 90 previous appearances prior to considering this data.  This was chosen by generating a list of bigrams for a range of smoothing parameters and seeing how many of the bigrams were shared between neighboring values.  When the shared fraction reached 95%, we judged the solution to have converged.  Note that `min_df` should not be set too high, where it could exclude these borderline words."

The food is also great if you're a fan of the diner-type grub; my hot turkey sandwich will live on in my dreams.\\n\\nYou can definitely tell the place has the old time appeal of a great family place as all the locals (mostly older people) know each other and it's clear it's the happening place for breakfast with the over-60 crowd (but hey, that says the food has to be pretty homestyle and tasty to me.)  \\n\\nIf you're headed down 94 and need a good lunch stop, make this it.\",\n",
       " u'Very nice and clean place to have breakfast or lunch',\n",
       " u'This place is pretty dumpy - \"Corinthian leather\" chairs, crappy tables...\\nWhat is worth going for is the walleye and eggs served on weekends.  It is a HUGE portion of walleye, lighty fried, served with eggs cooked to order, potatoes and toast.  All this for something like $10.  Totally worth a side trip if you are in Madison.',\n",
       " u\"I've been to this place a couple of times and we've always had good food. Service was a bit slow, but will definitely keep going back. Love being so close to Lake Waubesa and watching the sunsets too.\",\n",
       " u'Food and service have always been good.  The seafood dinner was done perfectly.',\n",
       " u\"It was ok - waitress was very good - even with 7:45 Friday night reservations no tables were available and had a very long wait - drunk patron at the bar swearing very loud with the F-bomb and other words and slamming items on the bar - first ordered the salmon special and of course it was already sold out - two of us then ordered the fish fry mine was lukewarm and the other one was cold. Don't plan on going back.\",\n",
       " u\"Good enough for carry-out in McFarland on a cold winter's evening.  Ready on time, never had a wrong order, and they're at least reasonably friendly.  Would be better if they delivered, but not sure there's a huge demand for it in our tiny burg.  They also have a lunch buffet on weekdays for around $6.\",\n",

I always think of it as the place that used to be a carwash.\\nAnyway.  Went with a group of 15.  Mom was buying and we got the \"Classic\" banquet (the cheapest one).  It was more food than we could eat.  The food was fine.  Not awesome.  The best flavor was hoisin sauce and, well, that comes out of a jar.\\nWe got a sesame chicken that had nicely deepfried chicken chunks in a citrus-y sweet sauce.  Some trout that my sister insisted on and really enjoys (not my thing, but everyone else liked it).  Mu-shu pork - it was good.  Delightful (?) beef, kinda bland, but nothing yucky in it.  Aaaannd, oh yeah, crispy duck.  Very crispy, as in dry.  Not so great.\\nThe kids got those finger trap toys with their fortune cookies.  The waitress was cheerful, accomodating and informative.  Extra help came out when needed.',\n",
       " u\"Took four kids tonight and we were all underwhelmed. The chicken egg drop soup was oddly sweet. We got a barbecue pork dish and some beef dish that both had a bland gravy. A huge platter of pot stickers that got everyone excited but ended up being ... bland. Even the dipping sauce just tasted like soy sauce. The calamari was not tough. I'll give them that. If this is the best Chinese food around... I'm sorry.\",\n",
       " u\"This place is wonderful.  One, Almost anything on the menu can be made gluten free.  Two, They have about 7 different types of loose teas to choose from.  Three, The food is GREAT!\\n\\nMy favorite dishes are the Three Delicacies Sizzling Rice Soup and  the Tofu Lettuce Wraps.  I am not lying when I say that I have NEVER had a dish I didn't like here.  The food is never greasy, never oversauced and never overcooked.  The seafood and veggies always have a really fresh taste... I seriously have no complaints at all.\\n\\nI miss you.\",\n",
       " u'What a crushing experience.\\n My son was in town and when he is here we like to visit and spoil ourselves to a splurge of a dinner outing. This particular night was at the end of summer and there was an amazing thunderstorm about to occur. SO on this stormy night we decided on Chinese and I had recommended we drive to Middleton for what I had heard to be the best around.\\nOk..so after a short 15 min drive we had a great parking spot...  ran inside and were greeted with a warming beautiful atmosphere.. very welcoming large foyer, nice bar area which u walk thru to get to your dining area.\\nAfter the immediate seating, WE were greeted  by a pleasant asian woman and ordered drinks. which turned out to be just right.\\n\\nAppetizers were mediocre...nothing to remember...we had the app for two...calamari was HORRIBLE  btw  I could go into so much detail but who is gonna read all that....the following is my reason for writing...\\n\\nMy forewarning is NOT TO TRUST in ordering the Lobster dish. I wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ Lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation. Ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best.\\nMore importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as Market Price. She said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2.5 pds or larger. So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering. I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.\\nWhat arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. The meat was still in shell. (and I mean IN SHELL).  There was hardly any meat to be had. The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.  I was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean.There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce. All in all an EXTREME disappointment. Not what I was expecting in the LEAST!!\\n\\nAs the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified. I will NEVER return. I cannot tolerate being misled by a server\\n We ended up tipping and not making a fuss...just another lesson learned. The storm raged on , I did get to spend time with my son and hopefully educate you.. Not a total loss I guess.Just stay away from places like this that lie for profit and have followings that end up being ill fated.',\n",
       " u'Absolutely THE worst!  This place won \"Best of Madison\" for Chinese food for how many years??? The judge must have been completely stoned out of his mind! \\nCustomer service:  Very poor.  The server never checked back until I went looking for her, wondering where our order was 50 minutes after ordering. \\nFood finally arrived for our group of four--STONE COLD!  Plates themselves were hot but practically frostbite on the food.  Couldn\\'t eat it. \\nManager came by, apologized and took 50% off the bill (!!!). Should have been 100% comped. \\nI\\'m one of those folks who normally overlooks a lot and actually hates to complain, but this culinary travesty really needed to be reported.  If this place previously had great food and service, then as of 2014 they\\'ve completely lost their \"mojo\".',\n",
       " u'This is our go-to Chinese restaurant in the Madison area.  Hands down, it\\'s the best Chinese I\\'ve found so far.  I\\'d give it 5 stars if the prices were more reasonable and the dine-in environment was better.\\n\\nLike I said, the food is superb.  My usual dish is Cashew Chicken.  It\\'s hard to deviate from that when it\\'s sooooo good.  Other dishes are excellent as well.  What I like about Imperial is that the meat quality is good.  The beef is tasty and tender - not tough or \"questionable\".  The chicken is good as well - not some of the gray chicken-like material found at lesser establishments.  \\n\\nWe don\\'t dine in often or at all.  It\\'s a little more formal than I prefer, and the experience can take a while.  Just not my preference.  I keep their number in my phone and call ahead for carry-out.  That\\'s the way to go here, imho.\\n\\nTheir location is very convenient for those of us that work in town and live in the western \\'burbs.  The portions they give out are very fair - my cashew chicken typically leaves me with a nice lunch for work the next day. \\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for top-quality Chinese food, I highly recommend getting take-out here.  If you don\\'t mind a more formal setting and have the time, go ahead and dine in.',\n",

       " u\"I love their taco loco. It's a mouthwatering fajita/taco salad concoction that I\\n a. can't get enough of and\\n b. can't finish.\\n\\nI have tried a few other dishes and nothing ranks near the crazy taco.  Warm, thick chips and a mild salsa are served bountifully. The chips aren't greasy and are not heavily salted which makes me happy. I like to add my own anyway.\\n\\nThey have three versions of guacamole. Yesterday we tried the most basic which was delicious and simple. We also tried an appetizer with cheese and chorizo. It was good, but quickly coagulated which resulted in an undip-able dip.\\n\\nMARGARITA ALERT- their house margarita... not a traditional margarita. In my opinion, it tasted like watered down orange soda. And the color is a light peach color. If you want a classic, lime margarita I have yet to find one I love here.  I'm not your typical margarita drinker.  The aftermath of too much sweet margarita mix and I do not get along.  I admit,  I'm kind of picky about margaritas, but these, these should have a warning when ordering.\",\n",
       " u\"I joined a few coworkers for lunch here today... I've not been a huge fan of Mi Cocina, so I hoped the new location and fresh look would've improved the experience.\\n\\nIt's still just barely passable as Mexican food.  Most entrees appear to be drowning in sauces, cheese, and other gooey/greasy stuff.  The salsas are extremely watery and lacking in flavor.  The guacamole (not the tableside-made) is bland and pasty.\\n\\nI ordered a pollo ensalada (chicken salad), which arrived as a bowl of super watery iceburg lettuce, a slab of seared chicken breast, 4 small slices of cucumber, a spoonful of pico de gallo, and a huge glob of guacamole (which I scraped off and set aside).\\n\\nThe salad was ok, but as I neared the end, I literally had what looked like a small soup bowl's worth of water resting in the bottom.  \\n\\nMy coworker's entrees were drenched in various cheese sauces/red sauces; the taco combo was blanketed in cheese.  They loved it, but my guts would've been complaining for days... \\n\\nSo, enjoy the new location and ambiance - just don't expect better food.  Those who've had real Mexican food will not enjoy this place...\\n\\nCocina Real/Mi Cocina = FAIL\\n\\nFood = 2 stars\\nService = 3 stars\\nValue = 2 stars\\nMISC = 3 stars\",\n",
       " u\"I've been back here several times since my first review, and have been continually impressed with Prairie. The food is always spot on and the atmosphere is so comfortable. The cafe sandwiches take one step towards gourmet--the tuna and egg salads are made in-house with a little twist from the same old. All are served with a choice of side; I favor the black bean and corn salad. Breakfast is no exception to Prairie's perfection--my scrambled eggs with spinach and pesto were fresh and filling. And it's hard to go wrong with any of the real fruit smoothies or coffee drinks. Prairie is exactly the way a cafe should be.\",\n",

It was warm but took fooooooooorrrr-eeeeeeev-errrrrrrrrrr.  It was just okay. They don\\'t accept plastic. I can understand your local dive bar or small coffee shop not wanting to accept plastic, but for what (I think) they are trying to do here, I would expect them to accept cards. But they don\\'t. If you think about it, it almost seems like they are going back to the good ol\\' days of the general store. Middleton\\'s one-stop shop.  You can check your postal box, get your coffee, get your paper, and buy random goods. Besides a hitching post for your horse, what more could you need?\\n\\nTake it. Leave it. Whatever.',\n",

The teriyaki chicken and cream puffs are my favorites and even though the chocolate covered fortune cookie was meant for little kids, I still have the balls to ask for one lol. Overall, not a bad choice at all.\\n\\nOh and I'll say it straight off the bat, this place is not authentic asian food.

They do something to make this sandwich just magical. SO good - I want one every time I hear Hody. Yum. \\n\\nThey also have awesome Quesadilla's too. We usually get ours with spicy, but I think you can customize. Otherwise a decent bar with average prices and service. Good TVs and a very local crowd. I think they have small bands on the weekends.\",\n",

       " u'Not knock your socks off but good. Atmosphere in the downstairs dining room is nice quiet. A good place to go with friends and have a conversation.  I had the escargot which was good -- could have had a little more garlic. Red beans & rice was especially good. Salad was average. For out of towners staying at the \"big box\" motels at the edge of town this place is way better than the chain restaurants around the motels and well worth the short walk into town (maybe not in winter).',\n",
       " u\"Think upscale semi-authentic Luisiana with a romantic jazz overtone. The food is really quite great, and I would never pass up the catfish. It was blackened and served with a sauce that was indescribable. For a starter I got the stuffed mushrooms with tasty craw fish filling. For desert... yeah that wasn't going to happen I was stuffed! The total bill for me was $37, which was reasonable considering the quality, ambience and how friendly the service was.\\nThe only missing star was that we had trouble finding our server as we were trying to pay our bill (it had already been dropped off but then he was gone!)\",\n",

They had live music that fit the scene, made the atmosphere, and stayed background enough to have a conversation - check it out Tuesdays through Saturdays.\\n\\nOrder the pecan catfish with the crawfish BBQ on top, aka \"Maria\\'s special\". It sounds wacky but the pecans really go with the blackened catfish. The tasso and shrimp fettuccine - a combination of shrimp, smoked ham, and mustard cream sauce sounds like a questionable combination but it is soothing, hot soul food at its fanciest. Everything we ate had depth, richness, and finesse. If you are a soup snob, definitely get the soup over the salad option. Presentation was lacking but I don\\'t think that\\'s the point of soul food.  \\n\\nService is sassy but whole-hearted. We walked in without reservations at 7pm on a Friday and when we asked if we could sit at the bar we were told \"yeah, if you can find seats\".  We found a couple stools and ordered dinner at the bar. It isn\\'t bend over backwards service, but they are real people and sometimes that\\'s better. Maria, our bartender who\\'s worked there 13 years, gave excellent food and drink recs and was really attentive despite the rush - she basically made our night. \\n\\nIt\\'s a great place to bring guests if you want to head off to a chill and unexpected place. Even better if you\\'re prepared to stuff your faces with well-executed comfort food. Try the Sazerac if you want a stiff, sweet drink and the Hurricane if you want a fruity, refreshing beverage that punches like a Long Island. The crowd here is mature and casually well-dressed.',\n",

We ordered four appetizers to split and all of them were delicious. I had a steak which was cooked to perfection. The service was excellent. The wine they recommended was delicious. We split several desserts and they were delicious as well.

The kids menu is great - my little guy destroyed their mini corn dogs.\\n\\nThe staff is very friendly and helpful.  The owners put a lot of hard work and time into this place, and it shows.

The bartender was ON - never missed a beat, never left our glasses empty, and was very helpful.  5+ stars.\\n\\nDrinks? Limited tap selection, although they have a few interesting items: Great Lakes Ale and Esthers Best were two that stood out as fun and not what you\\'d normally find at a more mainstream location.  They also have daily drink specials - we tried the Lemon Smash (hand squeezed (with each drink) lemonade + vodka) and the Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour.  Both were great.\\n\\nFood? We tried the famous chili - meaty, slightly spicy, and delish.  Not the best I\\'ve ever had, but not bad by any means.  We tried the vegetable beef soup - hearty, loaded with veggies, and the meat was tender and of good quality.  \\n\\nFor our entrees, we went a bit conservative - grilled chicken salads - but they were huge and tasty.  Fresh, fresh, fresh veggies - the tomatoes were wonderful as were the onions (red, and soooo sweet).  The salad was definitely an unexpected surprise - I\\'d get it again in a heartbeat!  \\n\\nOur dining companion ordered some chicken strips which he requested be tossed in their hot wings sauce.  The result?  Wow - tasty, especially if you\\'re a fan of vinegar-based wing sauce that packs a bit of a kick.  Really, really good.\\n\\nSo, we\\'ll definitely be back - I\\'m becoming a huge fan of the \"local\" places, and the Village Green is definitely a \"local\" place.  I can\\'t wait to try a burger or to enjoy some of their other drink specials.\\n\\nVillage Green = WIN\\n\\nFood = 3.75 stars\\nService = 5 stars\\nValue = 2.75 stars (a bit pricey; $35 for 2 with drinks)\\nOverall = 3.75 - 4 stars (atmosphere, service, general vibe, selection = big boost)',\n",

My colleagues had the eggplant parmigiana, which looked and smelled delicious, and a chicken dish that I can't remember the name of, but which also looked pretty good.  \\n\\nI'm not sure Vin Santo is the best place for a business dinner, but for a romantic date, it's perfect.  I will make sure to come back here whenever I am in the Madison area, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a hearty, delicious Italian meal.\",\n",
       " u\"We love Vin Santo and have gone there about every month or two for 3 years. Small place, warm and inviting, and the lovely host/owner Clarissa greets us like family when we walk in. Her husband/chef makes fabulous and imaginative sauces to accompany the comforting Italian dishes. Their italian sausage is probably the best we've had anywhere (including fancy places in LA, NYC, Philly, etc).\\n\\n There are special lasagna, fish, and ravioli dishes every night. The lasagna is cooked to order so it takes a while, but is so worth it. If you are lucky enough to go on an Italian sausage lasagna night, the portion is enormous, and every bite (yes, every bite) includes sausage and cheese - it's the bomb. I had a veal ravioli in a butter sage sauce recently that was fabulous, and unlike some pricey new Italian places where the portion is 5 or so ravioli, this dish had 10 or 12 large ones. In fact, all the portions are large, and really reasonably priced. Their wine selection is pretty sparse, and we haven't had good look finding one we like. But that is the only down side to what is always a fantastic and totally filling meal.  \\n\\nWe are usually too full for dessert, but they do make their own tiramisu, which is light, fluffy, creamy, and enormous. Get one if you have someone to share it with. Recently they have added a couple of desserts, including a caramel cheesecake, which I hope I am not too full to try someday.\",\n",
       " u'Great Italian eatery. The atmosphere is homey and intimate. I had the spaghetti with pine nuts, olives, capers, and anchovies in homemade tomato sauce. This dish was alright. I liked the idea of adding pine nuts, but the olives AND capers made it too salty for my tastes. I had some leftovers and they were definitely better the next day even if they were still a little salty. \\n\\nDEFINITELY get the Tirimasu cake while there. It was wonderful. Not too rich, but soaked in expresso and very flavorful. There is a mascarpone cheese based whip cream which is light and not too sweet that makes the cake amazing.',\n",
       " u'\"Ummm Good. Yummy. Tasty. What is this delicious piece? Do you wanna try this? It\\'s good.\"\\n\\nThose are pretty much what my bf and I said to each other during our Valentine\\'s day dinner. No footsies or romantic hand holding but just shuffling forks with an extreme eager to try each other\\'s plate. Vin Santo is THAT good. \\n\\nI got seafood Ravioli with pine nuts, which completely blew me away. It is by far the best Italian food I\\'ve ever had. They made their own bread: crisp and tender. Their Tiramisu will brighten up all of your taste bulbs. Appetizers and desserts are made for sharing, so be friendly to each other, less conservative and share. Go make a reservation now. You\\'ll love this place.',\n",
       " u'GET THE BREAD PUDDING!!!\\n...This is a nice restaurant that is cramped and casually decorated. The food is the stand out. The front is run by one of the owners and her service is very brief as she seats you and quickly moves on to the next task. The waitresses do a great job with the specials and describing the menu. Food is delivered in an acceptable amount of time. You can see the chef and the kitchen through the window between the kitchen and the dining room which is always fun. Their red sauce has a bit of spicy heat to it. \\nMy wife and I really do like this place for its great food and for its character.',\n",
       " u'Great food, portions could be smaller. A little pricey for Middleton. Would try somewhere else next time but would also not hesitate to return.',\n",
       " u'One of Middleton\\'s hidden gems.  It\\'s our favorite place to go for special occasions! Be sure to try the \"lasagna of the day\". It\\'s always worth it.',\n",
       " u\"Unbelievably disappointed.  I'm in town for business, and went on a week night.  They were not terribly busy, but as a solo diner, I was treated quite poorly.  Mostly ignored during my meal, I had to get up to chase someone down just for a water refill.  Not once did anyone check on my meal (I would have loved a second glass of wine), which wasn't stellar anyway.  \\nI did stop and tell the woman at the front that not every diner has the luxury of being able to eat with family or friends, and that I felt my service was horrible.  Maybe it'll spare the next person eating alone and hoping for good service.\\nI travel to Madison Wi frequently for work, and I can tell you that they'll not get repeat business from me.\",\n",
       " u\"I've walked past the Soup Factory numerous times on my way into Barriques. I decided to finally stop in yesterday.\\n\\nNow, as you can guess, this place's focus is....SOUP. They do have a wide selection of salads and sandwiches(both hot and cold). I decided to try the chicken and mushroom stew, and half of a caprese sandwich. I really like it when I have the half sandwich option, so I don't feel stuffed to the brim adding a soup. \\n\\nThe stew was really good, almost as good as my fave at Java Cat! The sandwich was decent, but nothing amazing. It's pretty easy to smear pesto on a slice of bread with tomato and mozzarella and squeeze it on a griddle!\\n\\nI'll definitely be stopping back in to try another soup this fall/winter!\",\n",
       " u\"The Club Tavern is an interesting bar. It has a wide range of crowd members from the youthful to the middle aged.  I've been to this bar on numerous occasions for volleyball, and hanging out. and for most times its been a pleasant experience. The drinks are fairly priced, there is a lot of space so you don't feel crowded and usually the music is fair. \\n\\nSome points of concern though arrive with smoking. When will they make it a state wide band to smoke in bars and restaurants.  The bartenders also seem a little snobby on occasion. \\n\\nI wouldn't say this is the bar to go if your looking to have a great night but if you want a fun/interesting night with some interesting characters make sure you visit.\",\n",
       " u\"Not my favorite live music venue in town.  They pull in good local acts weekly, and the drinks are tasty and inexpensive enough, but it's a bit too loud to enjoy the performances without blowing out an eardrum.  Do stop-in to see Moose, though - he's cool.\",\n",
       " u'Having won a free small frapee from the \"Family Food\" giveaway at another Burger King, I decided to go inside the Sun Prairie location to cash it in. This was after I waited for almost twenty minutes at the drive-through, even after the order taker told me she\\'d be with me in, \"just a second.\" Inside the lobby, I was met by a scene of dirty tables, slow service, and a floor littered with a surprising ammount of plastic gloves. When I finally made it to the counter, I was amazed to learn that it is somehow possible to take my order without saying a single word to me, and then simply walking away without even handing me a reciept. Perhaps it was this same top-notch service and accuracy that caused another customer there to have to come back not once, not twice, but THREE times because they made his food wrong. At this point, my instincts said to leave, but my honor required that I stick with it to the bitter end. But when I finally got the free frapee, I was saddened to say that it was not worth the wait. If you value your ability to eat at Burger King more than your time, I would suggest staying in your car at this location and living in blissful ignorance. As for me, it\\'ll be a while before I have it my way again.',\n",
       " u\"Remember when Burger King was actually somewhat decent?  Pepperidge Farm remembers...\\n\\nI have dined with the King many a time across this fine land.  I have watched their slow decline with sadness over the last thirty years.  At one point, they actually challenged the Clown for burger superiority, but now, they're a weak shadow on the market, barely a player...\\n\\n...and the BK at this location is a perfect example of why.\\n\\nEVERYTHING at this BK takes ten minutes.  Doesn't matter what you order, be prepared to wait.\\n\\nIt's always dirty.  When I was a kid and worked at the Clown, we were always cleaning.  There was usually one or two people on any shift whose sole job was to keep the lobby clean.  This place is a hole.\\n\\nWhy does the food taste weird?  If I want BK, I actually make the drive to Deforest, rather than eat at this location, which is actually a stone's throw from my house.  The food here tastes bad, bleachy, and wrong.  What are they doing to the food?\\n\\nFix thyself, King, and maybe I'll return.  Until then, I will take my cheap, poorly constructed eats elsewhere.\",\n",

       " u'Now reopen and beautiful.  Come in and check it out.',\n",

Great place!',\n",
       " u\"UPDATE:  This place closed down about a year ago.  Sadness. Another mom and pop Chinese buffet goes by the wayside of stretching themselves too thin.\\n\\n\\nI resisted going here for the past several years that I've lived in Sun Prairie b/c of all the other mediocre Chinese food buffet restaurants I've eaten at that left me a bit disappointed.\\n\\nTheir selection is less in numbers of dishes than other places around the Dane County area; however, in terms of quality and freshness, it's rather good. Since other reviewers did not go into significant detail about the offerings, I'll mention my first time experience recently on a Sunday (where there were about three other tables of diners):\\n\\n- peanut butter chicken\\n- mongolian beef\\n- chow mein\\n- a few sushi rolls (x2 varieties)\\n- crab rangoons (better than average)\\n- spring rolls (eggrolls, more aptly)\\n- popcorn shrimp\\n- two types of soups - your basic hot and sour or egg drop (these were just OK)\\n- chicken skewers (these were excellent even though I didn't expect them to be based on appearance)\\n- seafood stir fry w/ veggies\\n- fish fillets\\n- dessert options looked like a few types of cakes and fruit, pudding, and jello.\\n\\nI like the emphasis on quality rather than quantity. And this place was clean.  It's tucked away in a strip mall by Walmart, so points against it for location.  But you can't beat the price, $7-8 for a buffet meal!  Of course, afterwards, I had to nap off the food coma ...\",\n",
       " u\"I have been eating here for at least 7 years and it's excellent.  Typically a group of us go there for lunch coming from work.   I love the pepper chicken the broccoli and the chicken on a stick things.  Ohh yes, the peanut butter chicken is also excellent.  My 4 kids really love going there too when we happen to be in that area on a weekend.  They've been going there every now and then since they were babies.    \\n\\nI have heard that they may not be able to renew their lease as that part of the strip mall may be changed.  That would be very disappointing.  They have been a loyal staple spot for years while stores with in the mall have changed some of which are still vacant.   If you have not checked them out give them a try.  If you enjoy them go back for a visit incase they are soon gone.\",\n",

And that\\'s how we ended up at Cheeseburger in Paradise.\\n\\nWe enjoyed our bun-less burgers and gluten-free french fries (fried in a dedicated wheat-free fryer, unlike at most every other place that fries things) on the patio and were waited on by a conscientious and attentive server, Miles.  It was clean, colorful, and goofy and they fed me safely.',\n",

We were sat at four different tables near each other and moved the tables ourselves to create a configuration where our group could talk.\\nThe waitress asked a couple times if anyone needed anything, but great service starts with keeping water glasses full, so if you see an empty one - FILL IT! That is decent restaurant skills 101 and costs you a star every time.\\nThe food was cold, overcooked, tasteless and a little scary. I got a spicy burger and it was bland.\\nThe only way I would eat at this chain again would be if I washed up on a beach after being marooned for a week and they were giving the food away FREE.',\n",
       " u\"I have been here multiple times and have usually had great experiences, but last night was awful.  We made reservations as they had a promotion for National Cheeseburger Day and there were six of us.  When my friend and I got there, we told the hostess that we were meeting friends and had a reservation under another friend's name, and she shrugged at us three times before asking us how many were in our party and never bothered to find our reservation.  We told her we had an infant with us, and she looked annoyed to have to accommodate a baby.  She eventually asked us if we wanted to wait for the others in our party or sit down, and then walked us to our table and told us nothing about who our server was or ever cracked a smile.  \\n\\nWe sat for at least 10 minutes with no service and eventually flagged down a waiter, who found our server, who arrived about 5 minutes later.  The drink service was incredibly slow, and the food service was okay.  Our burgers were average, which was disappointing since we've come there often and enjoyed the burgers.  It seems their buns and meat have changed and the quality is not as good as it had been.  \\n\\nA disappointing trip, and we likely won't be back anytime soon.\",\n",

       " u'We have been dining here for quite a few years now.  It has consistently good food.   The pizza is fantastic.  They don\\'t have an increased topping charge for \"gourmet\" toppings like basil.  I find that annoying at other restaurants.  They do not skimp on toppings either.   I ordered basil and got plenty of it.  Not just a few pieces strewn about.   \\n\\nWe have always enjoyed our meals here.  The salmon tasted fresh and the pasta is very good.  They have specials and change up the menu on occasion.  The service is always great.  Everyone there seems happy to serve you, not just doing their job.\\n\\nWe have had them cater a lunch for about 50 people at work and they did an excellent job.  They accommodated for a special diet restriction without reservation.  \\n\\nIt is not fair to compare this place to an Italian restaurant in Chicago or any other big city.

No big deal though as it was always delicious either way. I regret that I have never had a po' boy from this place, but that is something I will have to remedy ASAP.

It isn't fancy, but it is roomy. My one complaint is that it is always chilly. I usually keep my coat on or I freeze. \\n\\nFood - The food at Dexter's is pretty good. It is slightly amped up pub food. It is most certainly better than your standard pub fare. They have some yummy options for spicy, heart-clogging sandwiches that my husband loves. I like the Fajita salad and pulled pork sandwich. \\n\\nBeer -  Fantastic. This is real the reason to go to Dexters. They have rotating taps of featured beer. They are attentive to trends in craft brewing and will often have something that is new and difficult to find. Their bartenders are usually knowledgeable about the beer, and they know how to pour a hefeweizen correctly. It is not the best deal you will find in town, but they will also have pours other places don't get. \\n\\nService - Also pretty good. I have no complaints about the staff here.

Local art and jewelry designers are supported there and there is a cozy fireplace! Good post movie date spot',\n",
       " u'Good food, comfy environment.',\n",
       " u'Another great local cafe found by the power of yelp! This cafe is right by the major highways and was on my way driving through IL. Its on your right side after you turn into the street and the sign is easy to find. This place has lots of seating, a great big fireplace in the middle with couches around it makes the environment very inviting to sit down and chat with friends/coworkers. I tried an iced mocha with whipped cream topped, they offer their coffee in 3 sizes. With my iced mocha I also ordered a chocolate croissant. Both were delicious and there were so many different choices in dessert that i want to try! Next time Im in the area I am definetly going to have to try their tiramisu!!',\n",
       " u\"Having heard only good things, I had pretty high expectations for Monty's but I felt let down by the service and really let down by the food. The meals ordered, chicken in a pie and salmon cakes were both luke-warm and tasted like they had lived under a warming lamp for quite some time. This place it not worth the reputation.\",\n",
       " u\"Grade; C-\\n\\nI don't understand why people make such a big deal out of this below-average place. Lemmings... Food Fight Inc. fools Madison yet again. Don't believe the hype.\",\n",
       " u\"I love the vegetarian Rueben and stuffed myself with the potato pie, but I haven't been thrilled with my breakfast experiences here.  I had the Scrambled Something or Other on the day that it happened to have asparagus in it.  I never did find any asparagus, but the eggs turned a horrendous shade of gray.  The potatoes were hardly cooked all the way through, but at least the biscuit was good.  I'm convinced the Mornay sauce is sausage gravy - I used to live in France and never had Mornay sauce like the stuff at Monty's!  Still - I give the place props for having so many vegetarian options.  It's fun to go out and have more to choose from than an iceberg lettuce salad or grilled cheese.\",\n",
       " u'Monty\\'s Blue Plate Diner is one of those funny contradictions-in-terms that is a restaurant which is both good but overrated.  Overall, though, it is far and away my favorite Food Fight place and a fairly reliable spot to get a good meal.\\n\\nMonty\\'s food is better than hit-or-miss but not quite consistently good.  Most of the things I\\'ve eaten there, especially the breakfast foods, have been delicious (and huge), but I\\'ve had a couple of very sub-par meals (one was so bad I literally could not eat more than a couple of bites).  The things that I ate and disliked are now off the menu, so that does say something for their ability to identify what\\'s working and what isn\\'t.  What I can say is that the egg-based breakfast-y menu items are almost universally good.  The \"scrambled something-or-other\" never fails to disappoint, nor does the newer Blue Plate Omelet (the one with cheddar, avocado and bacon... good lord!).  And the breakfast burrito is especially good, even without chorizo (which is how I usually order it).  As for the breakfast side items, the potatoes are just okay; the biscuits are great.  Most importantly of all, the coffee is superb (even my mother thinks so and she drinks a hell of a lot more coffee than I do).  Unfortunately, I tend to shy away from the lunch and dinner items so I can\\'t really speak to their quality.  The pies, though, are heaven.  And it\\'s certainly worth noting that the menu pays special attention to including veg*n options.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is pretty awesome.  Outdoor seating is spacious and comfy.  Indoors, the blue-topped tables are fun for making patterns with the wet bottom of your water glass.  Get a booth if you can; the tables are a bit cramped.  The waitstaff are generally friendly and attentive.\\n\\nThe upshot is that if you think you\\'ll enjoy eating at a diner that\\'s 70% greasy spoon and 30% hipster hot spot, and if you like breakfast foods and are a \"good orderer\" (you choose from menus wisely), Monty\\'s is an excellent choice.',\n",
       " u'I like this place because they have so many vegetarian options. I loved the vege BLT with strips of tempeh yummy :) I love the atmosphere of the place as well. I do think their prices are kind of high, but the food hits the spot!',\n",

Conservative couple on \\nthe third date and need to fuel up before doing it for the first time? Jackpot! As a bonus: With it's proximity to the storied Barrymore Theater, it is not uncommon to dine amongst musical geniusii. \\nDiner-esque feel and fare with lots of visual distractions (you may need them for the inevitable wait) You will more than likely hear screams of ecstasy after someone has the pie. Comfort food for the masses (Yes, you too my veggie sucking pals!) \\n\\nHmmmmmmm. Do you like the idea good-looking salt of the Earth houseboys? Well, whomever does the hiring at Monte's does too. I have not seen one unattractive employee yet. Besides being beautiful, they are efficient in their positions. The waitstaff is friendly and quick, cooks have yet to fail my taste buds, and the bakers make some of the yummiest cakes in the state. \\n\\nFor maximum food coma-ry, I'd recommend the (fake)meatloaf w/cashew gravy, mashed potatoes, a mimosa chased with a piece of Fat Elvis cake. Remember you are in Wisconsin and you don't have to have any regard for caloric intakes any longer, and eat til you either pass out or essplode,no judgment. In fact the fake meatloaf/cashew gravy is so fabulous, that I have \\nsent a mole into the kitchens of Monte's to snag the recipe. Yes, I am that powerful/desperate.\",\n",
       " u\"Love this place. Gets crowded around the normal brunch time, so go early or go late. Otherwise, it's probably going to be at least a 30 minute wait.\\n\\nHuge portions.

And I'm willing to cut them slack since they're always really busy. Plus they're pretty quick with the coffee refills.\\nEnvironment: Old school diner feel - with booths and stools! Doesn't feel cramped even when it gets crowded.\\n\\nSide notes: I LOVE diners. Also, if you eat the biscuit, you're a fatty.\",\n",

I AGREE!\\n\\nAside from the fact that it was freezing cold in there, I realllllllllly enjoyed the hell our of this place. First of all, the menu is composed of a bunch of awesome dishes; I wanted to order everything on the menu. It was as if they had scanned the portion of my brain that deals with Amanda eating habits and wrote a menu based on the data collected from the scan. Fettucini Alfredo and a turkey dinner!? Blue Plate, you shouldn't have! I'll order both!\\nActually, I got a turkey sandwich with avocado on it. I realllllly like avocado. I really like turkey sandwiches, too, and let me tell you Blue Plate did not disappoint. Everything was mad good from the salad to the fries to the sandwich.\\n\\nCheap prices, good portions... If you're in the area I definitely suggest you hit this place up. Mail me the leftovers!\",\n",

I'm a meat-eater and have had one or two of their all veggie dishes and been very impressed (I like the tofu scrambler)  Another favorite is whatever the scrambler of the day is.  Good reuben for lunch too.\",\n",
       " u\"I'm willing to shell out four stars.  I have not yet had anything bad on the menu.  The atmosphere is always pleasant.  Sometimes it does feel, however, that the wait staff pulls preference on the regulars.  If I lived in the area it would be a constant.\\n\\nI do love how everything served is local.  The milkshakes are so close to being the best in the area.  So close.  The pies on the other hand . . .  Word.\\n\\nIf you have a choice to make for eats in that part of town,  just go.  Take it all in and be satisfied.  Also, plan on going back.\",\n",

       " u'After moving from Chicago to Madison, I thought that I would be safely tucking my Lebanese palate into the furthest recesses of my tongue, saving it only for the occasional trips back to Kedzie Avenue.  That was, until my wife and I discovered People\\'s bakery.  \\n\\nUpon walking in, I was thrown back into the likes of such wonderful restaurants as Salam and Semiramis...but with Donuts!  We were genuinely welcomed in and I knew People\\'s Bakery was gonna be one of my new spots, having not even tried a single thing in the store.  \\n\\nWe ordered a lunch \"to-go.\"  I got a Shish Taouk (commonly known as a Chicken Shawarma) and my wife got a falafel sandwich and we split a side of Hummus.  Well, my Shish Tauok was plump with heavily marinated, tender chicken slices, tomatoes, tahina, and lettuce.  In short, it was outstanding.  Aggressive herbal flavors perfectly matched with a spike of lemony acidity.  My wife LOVED her falafel sandwich...which is really saying something, as she\\'s somewhat of connoisseur.  The hummus was really good, and the spike of sumac was a nice touch, although it was tad bit to lemony for me.  \\n\\nNonetheless, this is an AWESOME Madtown ethnic eats spot...and oh yeah...how can  completely dismiss the incredible homemade donut selection?  They looked stunningly good, but we both left that for another day.  Lebanese food and donuts....a winning combination, in my book.',\n",
       " u\"great donuts. great gyros.\\nand the most adorable owners ever.\\njust make sure you aren't in any rush, if you think about ordering food here. still worth visiting.\",\n",
       " u\"Donuts as BIG as your head!  Fresh Lebanese food made to order made by the friendly owner!  Such was my experience today at People's Bakery.  I don't really understand why the place was so empty today but it was fine with me.  I ordered tabbouleh, baba ghanoush, hummus, pita and a giant donut!   You'd never think we would have authentic Lebanese in a generic looking mini mall in Wisconsin but we do-I feel lucky it's just a few blocks away from my house. \\n\\nDownside = Styrofoam containers...I might attempt to bring my own next time to avoid them!\",\n",
       " u\"What do you get when you combine Lebanese cuisine, baked goods, gyros, funky interior design and second hand talk of bed bugs?  \\n\\nThe perfect #yelpnewvember storm, that's what.\\n\\nOver the summer, there was a spirited debate about where to find the best gyros in town after the unfortunate demise of Dmitri's.  After fellow Yelper Tawnie R boldly declared the People's Bakery as the worthy successor to Dimitri's, I knew a trip to the People's Bakery was in the cards for me.\\n\\nIf you are looking for elegant digs, this place is not for you.  It's a kitschy, little greasy spoon nestled into a strip mall at the corner of East Wash and East Johnson.  There's not a lot of seating and if someone is on the phone, you're going to be privy to their conversation.  In my case, I got a comprehensive update on a bedbug infestation of a family member that the owner's wife was describing in painstaking detail.  And while the chairs and tables are mismatched and the floor tiles are coming loose in places, the eating surfaces were all impeccably clean and the pictures on the wall gave the joint a homey feel.  And the husband and wife team that run the place have a great rapport with the regular customers getting their lunch fix. \\n\\nI ordered the $5.50 gyros and fries and grabbed a seat.  About ten minutes later, a massive foil wrapped gyros was delivered to my table.  I swear that an entire herd of sheep were sacrificed for this meal.  In terms of quantity, the People's Bakery delivered big time.  \\n\\nOn the quality side, things were a little less clear cut. First the negatives:\\n* The next time I visit, I'm going to ask to have the pita spend a little time on the grill.  This dish deserves better than a cold, doughy pita.\\n* More tzatziki sauce please!!!  When you give me a metric ton of lamb meat, I need more than a tablespoon of sauce to balance out the dish.\\n* The same can be said of the tomatoes.  I need more than two very thinly cut slices.\\n\\nNow the positives:\\n* The meat was served piping hot, moist and well seasoned.  It was clear this meat wasn't sitting under a heat lamp awaiting the lunch time crush.  The only thing I would have changed is to have a little char on some of the pieces to provide more textural contrast.\\n* The onions served with the dish were pure awesomeness.  I'll be honest, I usually pick most of the onions off my gyros because they can overpower the other ingredients with their sulfuric pungency.  With a medium dice, these onions were fresh and sweet and complemented each bite.\\n* I l-o-v-e-d the fries that accompanied the meal.  Salty and crunchy on the outside and hot and moist on the outside.   Yummmmmm.\\n\\nSo, does the People's Bakery unseat Trader Gus as my King of Madison Gyros.  I say it's too close to call right now.  What I do know is that I plan to return to the People's Bakery to conduct more extensive research.  And if you find yourself on the east side with an empty stomach and a light wallet, People's Bakery is an option worth considering.\",\n",
       " u'In addition to sweet treats like donuts and bear claws, they also have lunch and dinner options for cheap. Falafel is not the best in town, but try the gyro, which comes as a sandwich or entree sized plate. They have other standard Mediterranean options such as hummus and kebobs. Seating is limited and would not be good for large groups. Definitely more of a take-out place. I would definitely go back to explore their menu.',\n",
       " u\"I must say perfect... I travel for work and it was great to check into my room, find Rosati's on Yelp and have them here within 30 minutes. The food was much more than I anticipated...  A MUST try. Very well seasoned and the service was great from the phone call to the delivery... 5 stars all around!  The Spinach and Tomato Garlic bread was delicious!\",\n",

       " u\"Friday = Great Fish Fry.  All you can eat ocean perch.  Big bowls of slaw, tartar sauce, and lemon chunks on the table.  Dignified and refined, I wouldn't eat perch anywhere else in Madison.\",\n",
       " u\"As a Wisconsin native, Friday fish fries have always been a big part of my life. When living in Madison years ago, we used to hit all the great fish fries on the lakes around town. And while spending 10 years in Hayward, we used to live for Fridays at Lost Land Lake Lodge and later The Waterfront. Living in Utah for over 20 years, my opportunities are few and far between. So I was excited to have a free Friday in Madison to try the very best. Reading online reviews, going off my past knowledge and talking to friends, I made the tough call between the Avenue Bar (one of my favorite lunch spots) and the Esquire Club. We chose the Esquire.\\n\\nI hadn't been in the club in probably 30-35 years. Overall, it was a good experience. But it wasn't close to the level to which I'm accustomed to in Hayward on our three or four trips out there a year. We had a great time and I highly recommend it, but we would make another choice next time.\\n\\nThe bar at Kavanaugh's Esquire Club is great - a full horseshoe with plenty of seating. We arrived around 5:30 p.m. on a Friday in Lent. It was packed already, as was every spot in the parking lot. We put our name in and were told it would be 20 minutes for our party of two. We were seated in just ten.\\n\\nOne of the challenges with the Esquire is it just doesn't have a lot of natural atmosphere. The main room with the bar is fabulous. But the other dining rooms are really plain with not a single thing on the wall. The table settings are nice. And outside, it's a totally blah building. Out the back door to the parking lot was an attractive collection of a few hundred cigarette butts sitting on the sidewalk and snowbank.\\n\\nThe tables are pre-set with great, fresh rye bread and fabulous cole slaw. And we had quick attention from our waitress. The host gave us menus - actually three stapled, photocopied sheets - pretty tacky (I noticed others did get regular menus). It's a full supper club menu with multiple choices for fish fry. We opted for the $9.95 all-you-can-eat ocean perch. What was notable to me as that the current Web page for Esquire lists the price at $8.95. Not good. Cod was also available at a slightly higher price.\\n\\nThe bread and slaw kept us entertained and both were world class. A heaping plate of fish and crinkle fries arrived in good time (beating the Coke our grandson ordered 15 minutes earlier). We had to ask for lemons.\\n\\nThe fish was very good - I love perch. But as good as it was, it simply wasn't at the presentation and taste level of what we traditionally get at The Waterfront in Hayward, for example. It was a simple cornbread-type breading that was good, but somewhat uninteresting - not the flamboyant texture of the beer battered fish we have grown to expect.\\n\\nNonetheless, we polished off the fish, got a few more fries and a chocolate mousse desert. The bill for two with a few beers and desert was just under $40.\\n\\nLater that night, we also hit the Beachhouse in McFarland, another popular local spot. My wife had dinner there with a friend. This is an awesome place with a ton of atmosphere and great fish.\\n\\nEsquire Club Summary (five point scale)\\nExterior: 2 - Pretty plain building; cigarette butts not pretty\\nInterior atmosphere: 3 - Main bar room is great\\nFood: 4 - Good was great, not overally thrilled with fish batter\\nService: 3 - Generally good, but shouldn't have to wait for main course to get a Coke\\nValue: 5 - $9.95 for an all-you-can-eat fish fry at this level is outstanding\",\n",
       " u'TERRIBLE service, went here for breakfast and was in shock and awe at how bad our server was.  It took well over 45 minutes for us to get our food and there was only 1 other table in the restaurant.  I got our own coffee, drinks, half and half, ketchup and jam.  I will NEVER go back there again!',\n",

       " u\"It's like Denny's built a food court at a retirement home.  If fish fry and old fashions is your thing and you want to hang out with grandma and grandpa while you eat your food, this is the place.  The upper crust in Maple Bluff love this place.  The only thing I can chalk it up to is they can get wasted and not drive that far to get home.  Wood paneling decor round out this gem.\",\n",
       " u\"I went here last night with a group of my coworkers for dinner.\\nIt's been a long time that we've been to Olive Garden   The food was pretty good and the wait staff was AMAZING.  \\n\\nWe had the following: \\nChianti Braised Short Ribs (it's was ok, the meat was a bit overcooked/dry not juicy, risotto a bit too much salt.  Veggie seemed overcooked).\\n\\nBraised Beef & Tortelloni (really good, I was told my coworkers would get it again)\\nTender sliced short ribs and portobello mushrooms tossed with asiago-filled tortelloni in a basil-marsala sauce. \\n\\nCapellini di Mare (really good, didn't smell fishy, pasta was NOT aldente though, a bit overcooked for my taste).\\n\\nGrilled Shrimp Caprese (pretty good per my coworker, shrimps were not overcooked, pasta a bit overcooked).\\n\\nBut the overall high rating for this place was more of our waiter Craig D.  Can I tell you, we've NEVER had a wait staff being so attentive for our party of 5.  He knew who got what, the timing of our drinks/salad/soups/main meals were on spot, like clockwork.  He made sure our drinks/water was full, the bread was fresh and warm, salad and soup refills even without us asking for more.  He made us feel like we were in a 5 star restaurant, really.  What great service, next time when we're back in town we'd go back again!\",\n",
       " u'One of the employees stole my sons wallet.  He left it at the table and with in a half hour is disappeared.

Ever watch restaurant undercover on Foodnetwork.  The management actually laughed at me that i would think the employees would steal.',\n",
       " u'Olive Garden is Olive Garden.  What can you say?  \\n\\nOn this visit, I was with a group of 8 people.  It was insanity.  They sat us at two tables which made a weird shape.

       " u\"Good food, good service and clean.  I had the cashew chicken, my wife had the general tsao's chicken and my son had chicken fried rice.  All were very good.

       " u'Stopped by for a late meal on a Thursday night and the place was quite lively, but there were still a few tables open.  The servers all seemed to be having a good time and took excellent care of us, checking in just enough but not too much.  \\n\\nThe menu is small, but has something for everyone.  We tried the carnitas - flavorful and tender - and a burger - expertly seasoned and juicy.  Both were slightly overcooked: the burger arrived more medium rare than the requested rare, and on the carnitas the yolk of one fried egg was deliciously soft, while the other was just a bit too set.  However the high quality ingredients and delightful flavors evened out any imperfections.  The drink menu was well rounded and we enjoyed both the beer and cocktails.  \\n\\nThe small touches in design elevate the interior from the ordinary in an entirely pleasing way.  Tip Top is a great addition to the neighborhood and I look forward to enjoying it again soon.',\n",
       " u\"Finally go to the Tip Top last night for dinner and had a great experience.  Great job with the remodel, and the outdoor patio is very nice as they put up a high enough fence to block the street and make it private, but it is lareg enough to be fun.\\n  Excellent liquor and beer selections at reasonable prices.  Food was way better than expected - huge portions, excellent quality, and nicely different than the usual Madtown fare.  \\n\\nWe had fried pickles which were done with tempura batter so they were not heavy and the slight sweetness of the batter nicely offset the brininess of the pickles.  Huge basket with a great home made dipping sauce ( a remoulade) as well.   Then, thank God cause it is also big, we split a plate of two pepper mac 'n cheese, which was cooked perfectly and the jalapenos were offset perfectly by the poblanos for a flavorful balance.  \\n\\nTwelve taps, good cocktails, great service and a friendly atmosphere.  Hope you do well Tip Top!\",\n",
       " u\"Pretty cool neighborhood bar that's a lot more than just a bar.  I mean, at dinnertime on Friday night there were families eating here with lots of kids.  That's kind of weird to me.  First, I wouldn't think it would be appropriate to take young kids to a bar.  Second, I don't really want to be around kids when I go to a bar.  But everyone seemed to be perfectly happy with it, so that makes me the odd man out.  \\n\\nWe had burgers, and they were pretty good.  The menu had all the usual pub grub, and they also make pizzas.  Many people were eating them, but we didn't try it, so, shrug.  We also had cheese curds.  They were, well, cheese curds... (I'm sorry, I'm not a huge fan, so I can't tell the quality).  \\n\\nOne weird thing was that you had to go up to the side of the bar to place your order.  This made it confusing how to leave a tip.  On the table, or with the person you placed the order with?  \\n\\nOverall, we enjoyed it here, but we probably wouldn't come back during dinner hour, as the atmosphere was a bit weird for us.\",\n",

I try not to eat here without looking at the nutritional information in advance; the one time I didn't, I ate half an appetizer (loaded baked potatoes) and a salad and found out that was 2100 calories. There were also pretty substantial delays in service. My other half dozen visits have had excellent service and well prepared food. Maybe the staff wasn't at its best because they were here on New Year's Eve?\\n\\nThough I seldom use it, they have a very nice drink list, especially if you're a fan of tequila. It's also one of the few restaurants I know that offers reward points for eating there. All in all, I choose to go here for a standard night out with people who can't agree on what they want to eat.\",\n",
       " u\"Staff is super helpful when my party couldn't decide what we wanted.  Service was fast and packaged quite well (take out).  \\n\\nBarbecue pork shoulder was good, ribs were great, buns were good.  Something wasn't quite right with the sides though, we had coleslaw, potato salad, fries and beans (though I didn't try the beans) and while they were good, they were underseasoned and just missing something.  \\n\\nOverall a very satisfying experience and I would definitely go back!\",\n",
       " u\"mmmm....eerrrr... this is not real barbeque.  The ribs don't taste bad, but they aren't cooked slow enough, because the meat doesn't fall off the bone and all the flavor comes from the sauce that's slathered on it, not the actual meat.  The turkey was a insult to the art of barbecuing -- it tasted like deli meat that had been sprayed with liquid smoke.\",\n",
       " u'I take my BBQ seriously and because of that I researched on-line via Yelp and other sites various reviews of BBQ places in Madison, finally deciding on Smoky Jon\\'s No 1 B-B-Q.  Clearly the ribs have been highly reviewed so I actually went for the full slab.  Then it was a choice between the chopped pork sandwich and the brisket sandwich, I went for the pork sandwich from my fond memories of the same in Alabama.  Ordering over the phone, everything seemed to go well.  I then arrived about a half hour later.  There was 1 person in front of me who paid and was getting ready to leave when they brought my order to the counter and it was clearly wrong.  They had given my order to the man before me and I had his.  Apparently we both had the same first name.  Now this I was not perturbed by and was okay with, it was what followed that made me give this place 1 star.  So the counter lady tells me she\\'ll take care of me first before resolving his issue, great!  So she charges my card for 64.66 which was clearly way more than I should have paid for 1 slab dinner and 1 pork sandwich + 1 side of fried dough.  Should have been 1/2 that.  I told her and she couldn\\'t understand what I was talking about, I had to over-explain what I ordered and finally got through to her.  She took the bag back to the kitchen area saying some guy would have to deal with fixing this problem.  Now I was getting irritated.  She refunds me around 32 bucks in cash to make up for the overcharge.  I get a new bag of food and am finally done with the transaction, took about 15 mins to resolve.  Fine, I was happy in knowing I had a great dinner to enjoy soon.\\n\\nSo I come back and begin with the ribs, 1/2 a slab.  From the first taste I was not impressed.  I\\'ve had better ribs all over the country from Los Angeles to Alabama to Texas and Chicago.  Seriously?  This place has won all kinds of awards, I don\\'t get it.  Almost every other place I\\'ve eaten ribs in my 40+ years of life has been better than this place.  The \"sugar-fried\" biscuits are nothing with nothing, you can get better donuts nearly anywhere, seriously (again).  The fries dipped in the BBQ sauce were the best part by far.  The corn was pretty good too, but still a little over the top on the taste, hard to describe.  So after being disappointed, I checked out the pork sandwich, and oddly enough there were 3 small containers with the sandwich, and somehow it didn\\'t look like pork either.  I examined further, it was chicken, yet another screw-up with my order, wow!  And I ordered fries and mashed potatoes, neither of which was included.  Instead I found off-the-shelf beans, apple sauce (why?) which is not homemade, just spooned out of the jar, and the third container was BBQ sauce, which I didn\\'t need since I bought a whole bottle.  So the other part of my order was completely wrong in every respect.  And note, the chicken was not anything to write home about either.  I drove to the other side of Madison, which was a fairly pleasant 1/2 hour drive, paid around 33 bucks for a very disappointing experience.\\n\\nI strongly recommend NOT going to this place, unless you like to take risks, maybe you\\'ll like what you find, I know that if this is the best in Madison, I\\'ll have to go elsewhere in the world to find good BBQ.\\n\\nOh well...',\n",
       " u'1/2 slab and pork shoulder with sugar fried biscuits and garlic mashed potatoes. We need one of these in Philadelphia. The BBQ was so tender and flavorful.  Sides were good but not as amazing as the meat. Will definitely be back to try the brisket before I head back east. The restaurant itself is small and cramped but the food is worth it.',\n",
       " u\"I love this place! I had them cater my wedding, had the Pig up and Go package delivered and set up. We had BBQ pork, beef, and turkey along with sides. The only complaint I had was the turkey, I had assumed (and I know you should never assume!) it would be fresh, shredded turkey like the the pork and beef, but it was the processed, sliced turkey breast meat chopped up. That set aside, everything was delivered as scheduled, the employee who dropped the food off was very courteous and made sure to give us clear instructions on everything. We also visited here prior to our wedding and I shared the whole rack of ribs with my daughter and my husband had gotten the rotisserie chicken, the helpings were huge, the ribs were thick with meat and we did not leave hungry! Way better than Famous Dave's ribs\",\n",
       " u'My awesome partner Chuck brought me takeout the other night. Delicious. We had some ribs and pulled pork sandwiches. Love the BBQ sauce. Potato salad was awesome also! Wish we had some good BBQ in Illinois!',\n",
       " u\"I gave myself an hour to eat dining in before I have to catch a plane. I ordered. I waited 45 minutes. It seemed busy and I was stupid enough to keep waiting even though I see the guy who ordered before me get his and leave 20 minutes in. I didn't have anymore time and asked them to check my order. Nope, the ticket was lost.\\n\\nI was so hungry and so sad that I couldn't get any ribs. In the state of chaos that the kitchen and staff was in, there was no way they were gonna rush the order out in time even for to-go. I had to get a refund and speed to the airport. For what it's worth I don't think the 1 woman on wait staff was to blame. The owner really threw her under the bus by understaffing on a busy night. There's so many people, so many orders. There was another girl just taking orders. Just standing and waiting, while the other woman ran back and forth with bags and bags of food. What kind of restaurant is this? It's such a weird sight in a restaurant: one girl running another girl standing.  But at least I know she put my ticket into the kitchen. Someone fucked up in the kitchen; someone threw away my ticket. I will not be coming back and will not be sending any friends and family here either. For all the awards the place gets and all its years of being in business, I wish it just wasn't so amateur at being a restaurant.\",\n",
       " u\"I've lived in Madison for almost 3 years and have stupidly spent most of that time heading to Brickhouse BBQ whenever the porky craving strikes. No longer! This place is the real deal.\\n\\nI can't speak to the entire menu because I order the same thing every time I'm there: pulled pork sandwich, garlic mashed potatoes, biscuits. The mashed potatoes are stupid good, like, eyes-roll-in-the-back-of-your-head-with-the-first-bite good. They give you a little cup, which is good for me because I could eat a whole barrel of the stuff. BBQ sauce has a bit of a kick, but isn't unbearably spicy. \\n\\nOn my last visit, I saw they added mac and cheese to the menu (uuhhhhhh yummmm) but I don't know if I can bear to part with one of my other sides to try it. I'll just have to make my boyfriend order double biscuits instead.\",\n",
       " u\"Awesome!! Can't believe i drove by it a million times and never went. Best ribs!!\",\n",
       " u'The Jet Room is our go to place for breakfast with visiting friends.  The food of a down home diner, but with a huge wall of windows that look out onto the tarmac for WI Aviation...little commuter planes come and go while you eat some of the best breakfast around.  The pancakes are AMAZING!\\n\\nOnly issue is that TV is always tuned to Fox News, but on mute, so are easy to ignore.  A packed place on weekends - so call ahead for seating or get there early!',\n",
       " u\"I'm a big fan of eating Midwest brunches and I can tell quality vs. quantity.\\n\\nMy boyfriend took me here on a surprise date because he is a big fan of watching planes take off, so I thought it was novel to have brunch there.\\n\\nThe quality of the food blew me away as well as the friendly service. \\n\\nWe ordered crab cakes benedict with hollandaise sauce and the 2x2x2 (pancakes, 2 eggs, bacon, and fruit cup OR hashbrowns).  The other reviewers down below are correct that their pancakes are TDF light airy and buttery delicious. \\n\\nThe crab cakes benedicts were perfect - not too rich, and not too heavy and very nicely presented.  The waitress was a middle aged woman who was very attentive to us.\\n\\nThe price is also very reasonable for brunches in Madison. I would highly recommend this place, and I believe it is one of Madison's best kept secret diners.  It wasn't as cheap as the Come Back Inn located near the Essen Haus nor Plaka's Mediterranean meat intensive style brunches, however, the quality was far superior (and don't get me wrong, I adore the Come Back Inn!)\\n\\nYou'll also be interested in the proudly presented amateur photos of Air Force One from when President Obama visited Madison in Nov 2009, the staff were happy to give the run down of his landing at the private airstrip.\",\n",
       " u\"Unique place that is, as Steve said, a little off the beaten path.  Pat O'Malley's Jet Room is a pretty no-frills breakfast place (they offer lunch as well) serving up some good diner grub.  Bonus feature: You can watch planes take off and land while you're chowin' down.\\n\\nOut of all the diners in Madison that I've been to, the Jet Room service is the best; seriously top-notch.  Pat or his wife have been hosting every time I've gone (and have even remembered my name when I went a couple weekends in a row), the staff are friendly and always on top of things.  I get a pretty good mom 'n pop type vibe from here.\\n\\nI've never had a problem with the food here.  It's solid diner food; nothing unexpected or that exciting, but always delicious.  I like it enough that it's one of the few places where I'll try to switch my order every time I head over there.  \\n\\nWaits are long on weekends, so call ahead or expect to spend some time looking around the building.\",\n",

       " u'How I love Fat Jacks!  I would give it 5 stars, but it really isn\\'t in that upper echelon of BBQ restaurants (like Smoky Jons).\\n\\nANYWAY, the food here is really good, and they have 2 house sauces.  A sweet and tangy milder sauce, and a spicier sauce that tastes kind of like old bay seasoning, or bay leaves or something.  I really like the spicier sauce, and I wish they sold it by the bottle.\\n\\nThey have a good fish fry, their steaks and chicken are also good.  The ribs can sometimes be slightly tough, but that\\'s not normally the case.\\n\\nI love the decor and the true air of \"Wisconsin\" from the staff to the usual patrons.  When I am there sitting in all that wood paneling, it\\'s a nice cozy feeling.\\n\\nGo on sunday nights for the all you can eat BBQ chicken dinner for $7.50.  It\\'s a total deal, and the people watching is awesome.',\n",
       " u'Ate here last night.  Food was barely tolerable and the place was so dirty. Waitress stood in the middle is the dining area loudly babbling about movies for 10 minutes annoying everyone. Never  going back.',\n",
       " u\"I've been here a couple times now, and it's a pretty decent place. The food is delicious for the most part but some dishes can be on the greasy side. It's not too expensive, about the average price for dinner in town. The bartenders are very friendly! One problem is they don't take reservations at all, so if you end up going on a busy night you end up having to wait a good while.\",\n",
       " u\"What happened Tuesday night! They weren't even busy. The bartender (Mike) ignored our empty beer glasses twice even though we held them up to get his attention, there was no hostess to seat my husband and myself. The bus boy seated us and then no one came to our table until we had to ask a waitress where our waitress was. The special was gone so the waitress gave us a free appetizer for our long wait. The food was alright. Then waiting forever for our check we were given a check that was not ours. There was no waitress around so we left cash for the check we were given. I don't think we'll be going back.\",\n",

       " u\"The best reuse of a wee Taco Bell building EVER! This gem of Monona offers up authentically flavorful Jamaican food that will charm your palate without emptying your wallet. Affordable, friendly, and offering something for everyone who appreciates homemade, generous meals, from the vegetarian's delightful jerk tofu to the scotch bonnet catfish (personally, one of my favorite meals in all of Dane County) to the jerk steak. I can't stress enough the quality of eating the Caribbean food made in David's kitchen -you'll never go back to bottled jerk sauce again.\",\n",

       " u\"China Inn seems to have improved since I last reviewed. We used Grub Hub to order, which is a pretty good bet if you want it fast without getting hung up on. \\n\\nThey have also expanded their menu--sesame tofu, General Tso's tofu, etc. We ordered the Bean Curd with garlic and it was fresh and flavorful, lots of fresh veggies. It was not hot as advertised, but more subtly sweet.  \\n\\nI am pretty pleased with their progress. They even offer edamame and I hope to try the cold sesame noodles soon.\",\n",
       " u\"Lemme tell ya something.  Just because a Chinese restaurant has Mapo Tofu on the menu, doesn't mean they actually HAVE Mapo Tofu.  Yuck.  After having it at Ichiban Sichuan, and making it at home, I truly do not know what I just had.  It was NOT Mapo Tofu.  Maybe that's why I only had three bites.\\nThe hot & sour soup is, however very good, and my husband likes their Singapore Mei Fun.\\nAwesome delivery time.  Quoted 30 minutes, was here in 10.\",\n",
       " u'Great food, . fast.  We carry out from there at least once a month, sometimes more.',\n",
       " u\"What did I just eat?\\n\\nI'm not 100 percent sure.  I've been all over America and I've had sausage gravy over biscuits just about everywhere.  I've been down South and had amazing sausage gravy.  I had really, really good sausage gravy at a Motel 6 in Custer, South Dakota (no lie!).  I've had passable sausage gravy and biscuits all over this great land of ours...but what I just ate at the Dairyland Family Restaurant comes nowhere close to being sausage gravy and biscuits.\\n\\nThe gravy itself was passable as gravy.  Lifeless and sad, but gravy.  The biscuit chunks in the gravy was where things start to go awry.  They were all uniform in size and shape (warning!) and they tasted not like sausage, but more like something that was killed out behind the dumpster last night.  Maybe it was raccoon sausage.  \\n\\nThe biscuits themselves are where the whole train truly derails.  They actually served that slop over freakin' Pillsbury, out-of-the-can, cook 'em yourself at home biscuits!  That, my friends, is unforgivable.  If I want that crap, I'll stay home and cook it myself.\\n\\nOn the plus side, the service was good.  The eggs were fine.  And the Pepsi I drank was sweet and perfectly carbonated.  \\n\\nThe decor of the place looked straight out of 1985 and desperately needs some updating.  \\n\\nThe price would be reasonable--if they had given me decent food.  At the price I paid for what they gave me, I feel a tad overcharged.\\n\\nI'm not going back.  Madison is a big town.  You can do much, much better.\",\n",
       " u'If Dairyland was in Williamsburg, Silverlake or Logan Square, it would get five stars hands down.  This is a sincere old folks place on the East Side of Madison.

Then someone else came up by the name of Joey{who was he???} and said drinks are on us, unfortunately both burgers have been taken off for our Birthday's. Really un-proffesional. they could have put them back on our card's. The worst Birthday burger ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\",\n",

Every meal I\\'ve eaten there just hasn\\'t set well on my stomach--especially the \"walleye\" sandwich. I even tried a salad in an attempt to find something healthy. The lettuce was wilted and what chicken they had on top was uninspired and as dry as a shoe.   I\\'ll keep trying, though. I haven\\'t had any of their soups, and if these are good I\\'m willing to rethink this review a bit. \\n\\nI will say they are very awesome with kids and generous with the free little dishes of custard for them.',\n",
       " u\"Every Wisconsin fatty loves a good butterburger, we all know that, but what sets this Culvers apart from the others is the fact that its hands down the best one in Madison, and maybe even Wisconsin. The food is always hot,fresh,well prepared,and served quickly and politely. The other thing is its cleanliness. Its restrooms are always very clean and smell good, and the tables are quickly bussed and wiped down to make room for the next customer. The floors are kept immaculate, and you will never see a mess on the floor or at the condiment station. I think this is because the owner takes great pride in his resteraunt, and is always there. I know this because I live close and eat here 3 times a week, and he's always there. Most of the staff has worked there for a long time as well, and are good at their job. This place is the blueprint of what a Culvers should be,and a shining star among the companys resteraunts.\",\n",

       " u\"This is one of those kitschy Wisconsin places that I love beyond reason, though the food is average. See my review of Brother's Three for similar sentiments.\\n\\nWhat's great about Toby's is the environment. It is a dark bar filled with old beer signs and locals, and for this, as well as the service and experience of eating here, I'd give the place five stars if my conscience would allow it.\\n\\nThere's a procedure to Toby's. You enter and sit at the bar. You order at the bar, and the server comes to get you when your food is ready, and then you are seated.\\n\\nThe bartenders make a great Old-fashioned, one of the best in the city. \\n\\nAt your table, you'll find an array of decent goods typical of a supper club: a basket of de-frozen rolls; a plate of celery, carrots, and scallions; again, de-frozen cinnamon rolls for dessert; and breadsticks and butter.\\n\\nThe best dish on the menu, one that I can't order, is fried chicken. They make it to order. Because of this, it can hold up the meal, which the server will generally alert you about. My friend loves the fried colossal shrimp, which is awesome and also $$$. I generally get the cod, which is good. I doubt any of the fish is fresh, but perhaps on the weekends, it is. \\n\\nAll meals come with a salad. Get the blue cheese dressing. You can also add blue cheese crumbles. \\n\\nIf you love fantastic service and Wisconsin kitsch, this is a great joint. Don't expect five-star food, despite the five-star reviews. The prices range from moderate to expensive.\",\n",
       " u\"We dropped by this place on a Fish Fry Friday which is a big night for Toby's. The place is so packed that they try to cut back on the time you take up at a table by having you order your food before being seated. You then stand around should to shoulder with other people who are waiting and you all have to work together to let the employees pass through. Our party was seated 20 minutes after ordering. \\n\\nMy bland plate of fish wasn't something I'll come back for. I'm just too use to food with seasoning on it.\",\n",
       " u'Walked in on a busy fish fry night for the first time.  No hostess spot, so we wondered around until a waitress barked at us to go to one of the bartenders.  The bar was two people deep so that was nearly impossible.  Maybe the food here is that great but we left after feeling very unwelcome.',\n",
       " u\"Horrible, horrible service.  I went twice before writing a review.  the first time I thought maybe it was an off day.  The second time, they lost me as a customer.  The wait staff was more interested in talking about their weekend plans than serving customers.  The food was okay, nothing special.  But, for the price, I expect a little more service from a staff that realizes they're not working at Denny's.  Hell, Denny's usually has pretty solid service.  This place will have to go to an extreme to get me to return.  If I could give them zero stars, I would.\",\n",
       " u\"I had the spinoccoli deep dish pizza and i loved it! It was very delicious but the only thing keeping me from 5 stars was that I understand that It was small and the pizza wasn't as filled as I would like it to be for the price. I also had the chi town appetizer platter and it was not bad. I could tell that the chicken tenders were made from scratch and the avocado egg rolls were pretty good! My meal overall was very filling and I'm extremely happy with my meal and service overall.\",\n",
       " u\"8/10/13 and 8/11/13 We stopped in to enjoy the bar.  They had Ale Asylum Hopalicious, Lake Louie Warped Speed Scotch Ale, and New Belgium Brewing Rampant Imperial IPA on draft along with several others.  Tasty craft beers found at a chain restaurant are rare from my experience.  We learned it was happy hour all day on Sunday for several food items.  Their chili nachos and Caesar salad were tasty.  We enjoyed their deep dish spinoccoli with sausage.  It's not on the menu, but they still make it.  They play a nice and varied mix of music and have several TV's for sports watching.  We plan on stopping in more frequently.  In the past this wasn't a personal favorite.\",\n",
       " u\"Easy ordering-on-line. Made exactly as I asked for. Piping hot. Sauce is SO, SO much better than their old stuff. Crust is like having an order of buttery-garlic soft bread sticks with your pizza. Delivery is super-fast, with charming, pleasant personality driver(s.) Our guests were apprehensive about eating Domino's from past experiences, and after the first bite, were practically inhaling pieces it was that good! I can tell that it is hand-made fresh. The dough is light and airy, the cheeses are tangy and savory, the meats are generous and better quality than most. My first choice in chain pizzas.\",\n",
       " u'I don\\'t normally order Domino\\'s, but when I do, it\\'s because I\\'m feeling extra lazy.  I ordered online, and got 10 of the 14 wings I ordered; I asked for them to be well done (which means send half way through the oven again), but they were squishy and boxed up before my 2nd pizza came out of the oven.  Pizzas weren\\'t \"hot\", they were barely warm, which means the oven temp wasn\\'t correct.  I ordered regular cheese and there was more red sauce than cheese (which means they\\'re short on cheese for the week).  I live 2 blocks from here, but will gladly drive right past it to go somewhere else.

They sprinkle fried garlic over it and I love the burst of garlic every time I bite into one. Service was decent and the wait staff was very attentive. We had papaya salad, beef salad, chicken and beef satay and green curry. Everything was delicious. I live in the very northern parts of Phoenix but do not mind the drive. It is worth it.',\n",
       " u'Oh, Gaprao Gai, how I love thee.  Nom.',\n",
       " u\"I was surprised at how good this place was. A friend and I went on a whim and the crowd inside was a lot older (60's-70's) and mostly just drinking. We ordered the Tom Kai Gai and I have to say it was the best I've ever had in Arizona. It was spicy but extremely flavorful the consistency of the rice was gloriously sticky.We also tried the hot teas I ordered the Gunpowder Temple of Heaven and she got the Lemon Souffle` and both were beautifully prepared and flavored. The Pad Thai and Panang were both spiced to perfection and the service was great and our waitress was so friendly and helpful I wanted to come back the very next day. They also work with you on how spicy you want your dishes so if you prefer an extra kick just ask but I'd recommend trying the dishes how they prepare them first since I like spice and thought they did a great job of making the dishes spicy but not to the point where the spice overpowers the dish.\",\n",
       " u\"One night we decided to look for a good thai restaurant in CenPho, and upon some searching and previous good reviews, we chose to try the Wild Thaiger. We started the meal off with the corn fritters. They were crispy and delicious and had a yummy cucumber chutney with them. For my entree, I had the Tofu Mangone and it was awesome. I love spice, and not just a little, I like a lot, and my dish certainly turned up the heat. We finished the meal with the blueberry kaffir lime cheesecake. It was creamy, cool, and a wonderful way to end a meal. I'm so happy to have found a good thai place!\",\n",
       " u\"It was fine.  A fine thai meal to have before a rock show downtown.  Would I go again if I were in Phoenix, probably not, maybe so.  The service was fantastic, the food was fine, the place just had a weird energy, or maybe that's just a Phoenix thing.\",\n",
       " u\"I have been here numerous times and almost always get the Pad Thai and always leave stuffed and happy.  I like Thaiger because I feel very appropriate drinking wine with my Thai food because of the swanky interior of the place.  I especially love the open air patio where I took my mom to dinner when she came to visit.  Some say this place doesn't have the best Thai food in the Valley and with so many options I would not be surprised if there is a superior Thai place somewhere.  However, in terms of classy Thai in Phoenix, you can't beat Wild Thaiger.  Also, I love the pun in the name.  There, I said it.\",\n",

       " u'Tried this place last night... its very good location with a nice patio. The food was fresh and was good. I only gave it 4 out of 5 just because I have tried Thai food twice now and really not impressed. Food not that favorable. I think I will be sticking with Chinese and Japanese.',\n",
       " u'Thai Iced Tea, Pad-Thai & Chicken Satay.  A trifecta of flavor goodness.  A great place to go for lunch because its right in the heart of downtown Phoenix.  Yay!',\n",
       " u\"The food here is good.  The curry plates are especially delicious.   Too bad the service is so stand-offish.  I've been here close to 10 times and every single time I've left thinking I should have just gone to Thai Hut a mile away instead, based solely on the long wait and inattentive staff.\",\n",
       " u\"Good foods. And nice waitress.\\nI'm a visitor from LA.  And I always want Thai FOod!!! That's why I found this restaurant \\n\\nI ordered...\\n\\n-Pad kra prow Kai : real taste of thai*\\n-Sa tey : Full flavor\\n-Tom Kha Kai : So rich and too sweet for me. But my bf love it (I'm. Thai)\\n-Pad c aew : More than ok but not great!\",\n",
       " u\"As someone who LOVES Thai food, I can really appreciate a good Pad Thai, and Wild Thaiger's is my favorite hands down!\\n\\nJust like the menu says, their Pad Thai has a plethora of intense flavors, to the point where every bite is unique.  If you love Pad Thai and haven't tried Wild Thaiger's, you need to.  If you don't love Pad Thai, it's probably because you haven't tried Wild Thaiger's.  :)  Seriously, this is one of the best dishes I've found in Phoenix.\\n\\nTheir other dishes are consistently good as well.  I love Chicken Satay, but most places only offer it as an appetizer, with a few skimpy chicken strips.  Wild Thaiger, on the other hand, has a filling Peanut Chicken lunch, as well as a Peanut Passion dinner, both drenched in their delicious peanut sauce.  Their curries are very flavorful and make for a superb and hearty dinner, but if you're going for lunch, you may want to consider Thai Basil up the road as their curry lunch combo includes a salad and other extras.\\n\\nTheir Thai Tea is strong yet creamy, just like it should be, and you can even add boba to it.  A must if you're eating anything spicy.\\n\\nThe service is very professional and timely.  The atmosphere is pretty classy, in fact, it's probably the nicest-looking Thai restaurant I've been to.  It's also the only Thai restaurant I can think of with a patio.  All in all, it has a very welcoming atmosphere.  I would feel just as comfortable here in a suit as I would a T-shirt and jeans.  It's a great place for dates, business lunches, or just some great take-out.  You might spend a tad bit more here than at some other nearby joints, but the quality more than makes up for it, I would say the prices are spot-on.\\n\\nOne day I'll learn how to write a review that's short and sweet, but I kept thinking of good things to say about this place.  Highly recommended!\",\n",
       " u\"Best Thai food you will ever eat! This IS my favorite Thai food restaurant! I have far too many items on the menu that taste AMAZING but don't miss dessert! My favorite dessert is the (homemade) coconut icecream with the fried bananas on the side. AMAZING! Simply amazing. It's my favorite dessert of ALL TIME!\\nI must add that I really love peanut butter chicken (a childhood favorite) and this restaurant gets it perfect every time!\",\n",
       " u\"I love the restaurant's billboard out front - tiger eyes peering at you, an invitation to try cuisine from faraway lands. This is what brought my husband and myself in. The parking lot is rather small, we were lucky it wasn't too busy. I can imagine it would be difficult to find parking if it was a busy night. \\n\\nWhen you first enter, you have the option of dining inside (to your left) or outside on the covered patio (right). We decided to sit outside since it was such a lovely evening. I ordered an iced Thai coffee - which was delicious. For an appetizer, my husband ordered the Dragon Eggz - dumplings with pork. These came out promptly and were tasty. For dinner, I ordered the Ginger Fish - breaded salmon with mushrooms, pineapple, onions, etc in a ginger sauce. Big mistake. The salmon was more breading than fish and was swimming in the sauce - which I didn't particularly care for. It was a disappointment, but I'd like to come back and try something different since so many other Yelpers seem to enjoy this restaurant.\",\n",
       " u'I have been coming here for years. And the service is consistently friendly; servers remember me and always have a smile. I love their new menu items: tonight I tried their Turtle Crab appetizer, which was very refreshing with fresh crabmeat and avocado. You must have their dragon eggz crispy...very tasty. I have yet to try their new entrees, but I will certainly be back again soon. Their Holy Basil chicken dish is hands downs the best, and at the best price. This restaurant is the best value in town and I have tried other Thai restaurants. All you need to see is their dedicated chef in their open kitchen to understand why this place rules!',\n",
       " u'I\\'ve always been a fan of Wild Thaiger.  It\\'s location is great, right off the light rail on Central in Midtown.  On my quests for eating in some of my favorite places before I leave Phoenix, I met a good friend for dinner here last night. The food was wonderful as always, but one think last night stuck out.  When we arrived, we waited at the hostess station for probable 3 minutes before we were greeted.  Very odd.  Then when we were seated, another 4 minutes later before someone came over to take our drink order. A person who wasn\\'t even our server.  Now when our server did come over, he was very attentive for the rest of the evening and the service was excellent. \\n\\nWe started with the Freshie Rolls. YUM.  These fresh \"Vietnamese type\" rolls were so yummy and for sure stand up to their name \"fresh\".   They came with a wonderful spicy peanut sauce.  I had the Pad Thai.  Thin rice noodles prepared with chicken, shrimp, and tofu topped with fresh sprouts, and crushed peanuts.  As always it was delicious and plentiful.\\nIf you\\'re in the area and want great Thai, give them a try.',\n",
       " u\"Busy at lunch, but this place is awesome.  Great selection but could do better on the service and speed during lunch hour. \\n\\nDragon Eggs for appetizer was good. \\nI had the catfish with a 1 pepper spice level and it was awesome.\\nSister said it was the best fried rice she's had in a long time. \\n\\nCheck it out but go on off hours.\",\n",
       " u'Wild Thaiger celebrated its 10th year anniversary this weekend!  This is a neighborhood restaurarnt with first class food.  The chef and owner consistently refreshes the menu to great delight!  You will not be disappointed.',\n",
       " u\"Ordered takeout from here last night and was disappointed.  The portion size for the chicken curry was very small and I asked to add extra vegetables to the curry (bc otherwise it only comes with potatoes and onions) and didn't see that they had added any.  The amount of rice they provided with the curry was also teeny tiny.  On top of that, a takeout order takes 35 minutes (I ordered at 5:20 pm, not a peak time).  Also they were out of mango for their sticky rice and didn't have any alternatives like custard or anything to serve with the sticky rice.  Meh, never ordering takeout from here again.\",\n",
       " u\"I've gotta say, not super impressed. The spot is cute and the food is ok. I got the chicken pad Thai and spring rolls. Spring rolls were kind of soggy. The pad Thai was good though. Really flavorful. Could have done without all the cilantro and garnishment. I prefer Thai Basil.\",\n",
       " u'Overrated. Service was slow, food was mediocre and a bit pricey for the service/food you get. I had satay chicken and the meat was dry and the sauce was crumbly. Then I ordered the pad-see-ew and it was super salty.',\n",
       " u'Really a 3.5 was the consensus between my husband and I...not really a 4 or a 3.  The cons- ambiance and size of curry entrees. The pro- flavor, I had the 24k and he had the beef.  Neither were very spicy (we love Thai hot) but the flavor very nice.\\nWe agreed that in central phoenix we would suggest SaBai Modern in comparison.',\n",
       " u\"I actually want to get this place zero stars but that is not an option. I went here with my family my aunt and uncle words are from out-of-town and I had suggested this place because I have had the food there before and it was very good. We got to the restaurant at a decent time on a Monday night there was three other tables, we asked to down in one of the empty booths but she told us that we could not. That we had to wait. . We looked around and couldn't figure out why it was a 25 minute wait. We said okay we would like to sit down the bar and have a drink my uncle and aunt enjoy a nice glass of wine. The waitress who was very rude, told us that if we sat down at the bar to have a glass of wine that we cannot sit at a table. We looked to her completely confused she said that we could not dirty two areas of the restaurant. I couldn't believe what I was hearing! We said okay and could we sit at a table, that we will stay at for dinner,  we will understand if they couldn't get to us for the 25 minutes we can still sit and have a drink, she said no we have to stand there or sit on the bench waiting for a table for the 25 minutes or we cannot eat there!!!!  We left the restaurant and I will never return. I have now read the reviews how the service has sank. It's sad because it was a very enjoyable place at one time. Big fat F for this place.\",\n",
       " u\"This restaurant closes their doors at 10pm SHARP!! My mom and I arrived at the restaurant at 10pm. The hostess planned to close the restaurant. Thank you Manager of the restaurant for letting us stay!!\\n\\nWe basically had 5 minutes to look at the menu. Our waitress wanted us out ASAP. I didn't look at the menu carefully so I just picked something out of the Specialty section. \\n\\nAnyway, the chips and salsa were awesome!!! Our basket of chips had three varieties: corn tortilla, blue corn tortilla, and a sweet and spicy chip. I really liked the sweet and spicy chip since it tasted like a slightly spicy churro. Yum!  The salsa had a black bean flavor and chunks of tomatoes. Also yummy.\\n\\nThe food came out so quickly!! It took like 10 minutes for the food to come out. Haha.\\n\\nI had the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast. mMmMM.. the stuffing was so good!! I loved the herb-goat cheese mixed with the red pepper cream sauce and the cilantro pesto. The chicken was very moist! The asparagus wasn't too good, as it was chewy. However, the southwest rice pilaf was so creamy and had a smoky flavor. I also loved the extra touch of the tortilla chips on top of the dish. Lovely presentation!\\n\\nMy mom had the Chicken Penne Pasta with the cilantro pesto. The chicken was moist, and the pesto had a deep cilantro flavor. If you hate cilantro, stay away from this dish!! There was a tad bit too much olive oil, but the strong cilantro flavor was awesome!\\n\\nIt was a pleasant surprise to receive a frozen white chocolate tamale. YUMMY! I only eat white chocolate so I was so excited to eat this. Loved the nuts and the sweetness. \\n\\nAgain, our waitress was not very nice to us. So I'm taking off a point for the service.\\n\\nWe were out the door by 10:40pm.\",\n",
       " u'\"Great Meeting Room in Back\" - We recently held a meeting in the back room and it was perfect. You were connected to the main restaurant, yet a wall blocked the noise so you could hear our meeting conversation. A glass wall to the beautiful Arizona Center gardens kept you from feeling too closed in. The server did a good job of keeping everyone\\'s drinks filled and timing our orders. She filled bowls of chips and salsa with a mix of blue and yellow corn and flour tortilla chips. The salsa was pretty good.We had the Salmon and a Sweet Potato Puree served with Spinach Salad. It was a wondeful tasty lunch. The chicken sandwich and an enchilada plate seemed popular as well. I think we will keep this our regular spot for our monthly meetings for the foreseeable future. So, ladies, if you see us there on the third Saturday\\'s of the month, come join the fun of the Network of Business Women Phoenix.',\n",
       " u'Had a nice dinner outside on the patio - it was really pretty. The margaritas were pretty good. The salsa and chips were also pretty tasty - it was nice to have some variety- these were no simple white corn chips; there were blue corn and even sweet potato chips mixed in. My fish tacos were awesome, I love spice and they certainly delivered. I would try it again and hopefully find another item on the menu that was just as good.',\n",
       " u\"Well for starters, I will say I had given up on going out for dinner so I ate a couple slices of warmed over pizza. We finally went and as I was less than hungry skipped the steak I had been eying. We split a Meatloaf and switched the mashed potatoes out for the mashed sweet potatoes. The two split plates were more than enough food for a regular meal. I can't imagine eating a whole one and I am a hearty eater. We also each ordered a Rico Rita. Yummy and again large portions. The service was good too. I used to go to the Camelback location and the quality and service is the same here. We will be back.\",\n",
       " u\"Stopped at Sam's for a work lunch. Great location. It's good to have places like this downtown. \\n\\nEveryone in our group enjoyed the food. From the variety of pre-meal chips, the entrees, and the post meal white chocolate tamales. \\n\\nI had the shrimp tacos an they were great. Fresh, rich with flavor, and very filling.\\n\\nI'd like to stop in after work some time for some margaritas.\",\n",
       " u'I stopped in with my wife last night, as we are both new to the city and were celebrating our anniversary. The food was great. However, the staff went out of their way to go above and beyond my expectations. They were friendly and prompt and the manager made us feel important as patrons.',\n",
       " u\"A date picked this restaurant for me and I have to admit I was impressed!  Sitting outside on the patio under the gorgeous sparkling lights on the palm trees, with the sound of the running water in the fountains nearby, in the heart of Central Phoenix.  It didn't even matter at that point if the food was good!   \\n\\nI've been back several times since and this place doesn't disappoint.  However, I would rank ambiance #1, alcohol #2 and food #3.  Drink choices are widely ranging so everyone will find something.   From your traditional margarita to a cocktail, the drinks are strong and well made.  As for the food, I've had a few dishes I liked - the black and bleu quesadilla and the fajitas tend to be my go-to.  I love the salsa too - it's a chipotle, smoky flavor - my favorite kind!   Best little treat is a white chocolate dessert served in a corn husk at the end of the meal.   Great little inclusion!   \\n\\nThis is located in the Arizona Center by the AMC movie theater, so makes it easy for a great dinner and movie night.   Then grab your date's arm and take a stroll through the courtyard, enjoy the twinkling lights and fountains.   There's no way you'll be able to resist the romance!  =)\",\n",
       " u\"I had never heard of this place when i went here for a lunch meeting.  We arrived about noon on a Wednesday and the place was busy, but not packed.  The weather outside was awesome and we wanted to sit outside but the noise from the fountains/waterfalls up against the patio was really loud to talk over so we sat inside.  \\n\\nThe chips and salsa they brought out was amazing.  The bowl had 4 different types and flavors of chips and the salsa had a good taste and spice without being too hot.  For a meal i picked the Meatloaf and it was a ton of food.  2 huge pieces meatloaf that was seared on a grill after it was cooked came out with corn & mashed potatoes and a roasted tomato BBQ sauce.  I ate the whole thing (even though it was more food that i should have eaten) and i didn't feel bad!.  The meeting was a little hard to pay attention to though since the windows faced the pathway and the women from ASU downtown and all of the businesses kept walking by!!!\",\n",
       " u'A couple friends and I went here after searching for a dinner place around 9pm on a weeknight. Much of downtown Phoenix closes up shop early during weekdays so it was good to find a place that was open with some life to it.\\n\\nWe were quickly seated and ordered some margaritas. They brought out chips and salsa that were actually very tasty. The chips are brushed with some sort of chipotle spice and served with chipotle salsa as well.\\n\\nFor my meal, I ordered the chicken fajitas which were decent, but nothing to write home about. All of the portions were pretty large, but I still felt that the prices were a bit high considering the quality of food.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and relatively speedy and they even gave us a little palette cleansing dessert to complete the meal.\\n\\nOverall, this place is a good place to get your fix for margaritas and Mexican food in Phoenix, but just be prepared to pay a little higher price than you are probably used to.',\n",
       " u\"I cannot speak highly enough of this restaurant. The chips are to die for, the salads and tortilla soup were awesome. To top it off, the service by our waitress TJ (Tammy J) was excellent as she made us feel like guests in her own home. We'll go back again anytime we visit Phoenix.\",\n",
       " u\"The margaritas here are good.  All of them.  We stopped in during our Cinco de Mayo, Tour de Margarita, and were not disappointed.  Unfortunately we did not eat during this visit, much to the detriment of our sobriety, but I'm sure there will be a next time.\",\n",
       " u\"Here on business, staying at the downtown sheraton across the street from the restaurant. I've been here twice this week and the food and service have been great. Chips and salsa are a unique blend of sweet and salty and delicious. Great margaritas. Both I can only comment on the fajitas but they are amazing. I'd definitely recommend\",\n",
       " u'Positives:\\n*Chips and salsa\\n*Nice outdoor seating \\n*Fish tacos with light salad was delicious\\n*Affordable prices\\n\\nNegatives:\\n*It took 45 min for the food to be brought out even though the restaurant was not very busy and especially after several inquiries about our order, stressing that we needed to be back for a conference.  Because the food came out so late we had to get it boxed up.\\n*Orders were incorrect.\\n*No apologies from management or wait staff.',\n",
       " u\"After having had some underwhelming meals at our hotel and around the convention district, this place was a BIG treat. The service was spot on, and we knew the meal was going to be good as soon as they brought out their special mixed chips and dark, smoky salsa. After our margaritas appeared (their special margaritas come out with a refill in the shaker), our entrees did not disappoint. Hearty chicken in the enchiladas and quesadilla, and our friend's intriguing 'naked' chili relleno. Portions were beyond generous, and thanks to checking in with Yelp we shared a dessert for free. We chose the banana burrito and had no regrets. Highly recommended. Sad that I won't be back in Phoenix any time soon - I'd definitely come back if this were in my city!!\",\n",
       " u'My Mom and I took my Grandmother out for tea for her birthday.  Tastefully tacky is how I would describe this tearoom.  Refined clutter is another.  The outside looks promising, a cute Victorian style house.  When you get inside you are met with all kinds of \"old style\" wares for sale, a fir tree and dried plants.  Yuck.  And what is up with a plant in the bathtub of the bathroom.  There were things for sale in just about every crevice some with a \"made in China\" tag displayed, how classic Victorian.  And in the second room, you are met with a whole bunch of clutter catch on wide display.  In fact, there was paperwork, calculators, etc. covering their bar area.  Make an effort people!\\nService was very uneven, our server was wearing a black outfit and skull socks.  A bit out of place.  And she made us box our own food.\\nThe teapot from which we were served was cracked and looked like it had seen better days.  And the room temperature needed some adjustment for a Phoenix summer day.  Also, they had a random radio station running playing everything from country to Cyndi Lauper - not what you expect at tea.  We had to ask our server three times to turn it down.\\nHowever, at this price point, the food was decent and well presented.  We had leftovers to take home.  We had taken my Grandma to the Ritz Carlton last year and next year I would rather spend the extra money and do the same.\\nNOT MY CUP OF TEA!!!!!',\n",
       " u\"It took a considerable amount of time to get a turkey and havarti, and peanut butter & jelly sandwiches.\\n\\nThe environment was very nice. And given the temperature outside, the cool of the a/c was a very welcome respite.\\n\\nNo kids glasses available, but that's less of a concern for me since my children are both adept at drinking from regular glasses.\\nBut it's a nice touch when it's available.\\n\\nI would return on a day when I'm in the Heritage and Science Park, but I'd not likely make a trip down there specifically to go.\",\n",
       " u'Great location if staying near the convention center or in downtown Phoenix. This is by far one of the best sports bars I have ever been to. I had a perfect view of ESPN 2 and the place had plenty of sporting events on other teles..but not too many. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is fantastic and perfect for lunch. Food is great and they had vegetarian options, a major plus for a sports bar. What is better than veggie options? They made exceptions for me, my whole meal sans dairy with no complaints, evil eyes, etc. This is greatly appreciated. \\n\\nThe evening scene is great also. \\n\\nAn overall 5.5 stars. hellz yeah.',\n",
       " u\"I can't seem to understand 'why' many people rate this as a first-class sports bar because in actuality, its one of the worst I've ever been in, and I grew up going to the sports books in Juarez, Mexico where their idea of a flat screen was a gabacho thumping the TV onto the sticky tile floor and looking cross at an hombre could get your eye cut out and fed to you as the special of the day.\\n\\nYes, Majerle's is worse.  \\n\\nOkay, well, no one in Thunder Dan's is gonna devour your soul, but the place makes me feel like I'm sharing a pint with Florentines Catello di Rosso Gianfigliazzi and Ciappo Ubriachi in Dante's inner ring of the seventh circle of Hell.\\n\\nThe set up is terrible.  The TVs are difficult to see from EVERYWHERE in the bar and they have it arranged so that if you are fortunate enough to view up to TWO SCREENS (!) at one time, they are both showing the same game.  This is a problem during major events like the NCAA tournament or bowl games.  \\n\\nMoreover, i would be kitten-hearted to ask a manager to change their programming to another game i'd rather watch.  \\n\\nThe bar is always crowded, which makes it even more wondrous for me when i actually go in there and wait for a seat just to encounter no beer specials and terrible food.\\n\\nI wonder how large the bowl of crack the editors at Sports Illustrated were smoking to rate this anywhere near the top 1,000 sports bars in the US.\",\n",
       " u\"My pub crawl compadres and I stopped at Majerle's after having a brief but terrible experience at Networks. I was definitely impressed by the modern stylings and decor. To give Majerle's some credit, they did actually honor their agreement to participate in the pub crawl, offering a drink special, but it turns out that the disgustingly sweet $3 Stoli strawberry lemonades were available to everyone. There were also no food samples. Why did we buy pub crawl wristbands again? \\n\\nWe attempted to make up for the slowly-worsening pub crawl experience by ordering vodka shots. There was some miscommunication between the bartenders because when the girl we ordered them from disappeared and another bartender approached us to ask if we needed help, we somehow ended up with two rounds of shots. Naturally, we didn't want to pay for both, a statement that got us quite a bit of attitude from the bartenders. The mistake wasn't entirely their fault (we could have been clearer, I supposed), but I could have done without the 'tude, especially since you can just pour vodka back into a bottle. No harm, no foul, right?\\n\\nAnyway, I wouldn't refuse to come back to Majerle's before or after a game, but I definitely wouldn't choose over 15-20 other places in a 5-mile radius that have great food, cheaper drinks, and friendlier service.\",\n",
       " u\"Dropped in late Sunday afternoon after shooting photos for a few hours. Was tired and welcomed warmly by Arthur behind the bar. He introduced himself and shook both and my photo buddies hand. \\n\\nWhile I had only a Coke it was refreshed with a new one when I got to about 1/2 way. My buddy ended up ordering two club sandwiches and judging by the fact that a) he ordered two and b) the plate looked mighty clean they were pretty darn yummy. \\n\\nI've been the Majerle's before this visit was very nice and I would definitely come back...will come back this time with an appetite.\",\n",
       " u'I have to give this place 5 stars. Yes, 5 stars! I am not a big fan of watching sports on TV since I love the joy of being at the game, however the energy at this location is better than attending a sporting event. The food is great. I mean \"GREAT\". I have enjoyed everything on the menu I have tasted so far. There is something on the menu for everyone and any type of dietary need. My favorites are the Boneless Wings, Chicken Strips (real white meat), and the Taco Salad. I am surprised the French Fries have not put McDonalds out of business. They are addicting. To top it off the they have top notch service. I have never had a problem, compliant or been disappointed. You can tell the employees love the place that they work out and enjoy to serve the patrons.\\n\\nMy office has had several private parties at this location. They have two areas where you can throw parties. My favorite is the Cotton Room. It is a private room that is very hip, urban, all white with glass mirrors surrounding the room. Kinda like a mini retro dance space. It has plush leather white seating, big screen tv\\'s and a private bar. The resturant does catering and take-out.',\n",
       " u\"I have been truant with my Dukedom for far too long. A review is due lest I be usurped.\\n\\nMajerle's (Mar-lees) is one of downtown Phoenix's great sports bar. It's great for pre-gaming before heading down the street to US Airways Center or Chase Field. It's great for post-game festivities after leaving the stadiums. And it's great for just watching any game with friends on any of the multiple HD TVs.\\n\\nMajerle's has plenty of beers on tap, a solid HH menu, and serves libations until around 2am every night. It also seems like it's a bonafide occupational qualification to be hot to work here, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. \\n\\nMajerle's is not great with food, however. They shell out the typical pedestrian bar fare, which is highly suitable for the typical Diamondbacks fan, but if your taste buds yearn for something more refined, you're much better off grabbing food at Networks Bar and Grill or The Arrogant Butcher down the street. \\n\\nIn conclusion, Majerle's is the slam dunk watering hole in downtown on a game night. Check it out!\",\n",
       " u'Worst experience ever! Just how long does it take to cook 2 burgers? We ordered 2 burgers, very simple burgers and after more than 30 minutes waiting, the server came to us saying \"your food is coming!\" After 15 more minutes, we decided to leave. I am honest and I wanted to pay for the 2 beers... 10 minutes to get the change! The server came to me \"Why didn\\'t you wait 5 more minutes? Your food was ready...\" Yeah right. The manager? Obviously more preoccupied to make the pretty servers laugh... Pathetic and unprofessional.',\n",

       " u'Finding ourselves at the Arizona Center at least once every 2 weeks for a movie at the AMC, my husband and I have discovered that Uno is a decent option when we have been to Sam\\'s a tad too often, and the ONLY option when faced with the prospect of another horrid meal at My Big Fat \"Greek\" Restaurant. We both like the deep dish pizzas (and I am grateful that they have tasty options for those of us who have tomato sensitivities), and the giant warm chocolate chip cookie sundae is seriously yum. The dinner salads are huge, but pretty mediocre. The onion rings are OK, but not as crispy as I like them. I also love that they have iced mint tea which I\\'ve only ever been offered in one other valley restaurant. The service was good and the place was clean.',\n",

Central Avenue and I-17, this place has the BEST Mexican breakfast on the weekend since the old Matador closed on 1st St.  I always go for their chilaquiles.  A generous serving of homemade red sauce over corn tortilla chips and topped with two over easy eggs, this is a dish that can easily be split with a friend.

Oh the menu. Its a little overwhelming, not in the amount of options but the amount of things that sound delicious! I chose the Chimichanga de Pollo. I was totally prepared to enjoy it, as is but then our waitress suggested that I get it enchilada style. Best. Waitress. Ever. Holy god was that thing good. The chicken was tender, the sauce was so so good, and it had just the right amount of spice. Its a large dish, that was equally good the next day.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this place for a sit down meal if youre looking for really good, authentic mexican food. And I wish I was still in AZ cuz writing this review has made me hungry for it!',\n",

The food is excellent and you can tell by how busy they are that they are obviously doing something right.\\n\\nI recommend the chicken nachos as an appaitizer. I don't know how they make their chicken so flavorful, but it's amazing. It's like charbroilled or grilled, so tasty. The nachos are basically 4 or 5 tostada's cut in half.  You get a layer of beans, topped with jalapeno's, cheese and chicken. A side of guacamole and sour cream come with this plate.\\n\\nThe chicken chimi enchilada style with the red sauce is beyond words. It's the same chicken used in the nachos. I basically lick the plate clean. \\n\\nI have also tried the shrimp enchiladas - too shrimp tasting for my taste, but my sister -in-law, who's big into seafood really enjoyed them. Comes with a lot of shrimp.\\n\\nThe carne asada tacos - were fantastic.\\n\\nIf you want really well done Mexican food don't waste your money anywhere else. Just come here. The wait staff is excellent and attentive.\",\n",

       " u'The food here is horrible for calling themselves an authetican mexican restaurant they are far from it. I am mexican and I can tell you their food is not at all good. Their tortillas are package their chips are package. The food has no taste. Not even my kids the usually eat everything like it. Their salsa sucks. I do not recommend this place horrible food. If you want good mexican food go to Pitic just around the corner or Carolinas.',\n",

       " u'YUMMY-cheap-FAST.\\n\\nLooking for a tasty bowl of chicken teriyaki?  You\\'ll find it at the Blue Fin.  The chicken is slightly wood-fired in the flavor department & perfectly sauced with teriyaki.  This place tops the charts in the speed category, you won\\'t wait longer than 5 minutes for your order and they have a drive through....if you\\'re in a hurry, it\\'s a win-win situation.\\n\\nLastly, they package their \"to go\" orders in the typical plastic t-shirt bags that every other place uses HOWEVER, Blue Fin bags sport the nifty little 70\\'s smiley face icon (which I am a big fan of)  along with the slogan \"Have A Nice Day!\"\\n\\nTry Blue Fin!',\n",
       " u\"The Blue Fin is a place I have probably driven by 100 times, either coming/going to work or heading to the library. I didn't even realize it was actually open until I got onto Yelp and saw some reviews. So close to my office, I had to try it out.....on a Sunday when it was closed. Oops. Let's try this again, for lunch\\n\\nThe place ain't big, so make sure you get there early, especially if you have more than 4 people. I also noticed they had their iced tea and lemonade in massive buckets, which is the ONLY way to serve beverages in my humble opinion. Quite like a lot of places in the area, the Blue Fin has a massive amount of pictures of their food up on the wall, so it does make choosing a meal that much more easy. A quick moving line and a 5 minute wait later, I had my teriyaki chicken bowl and was back to the office.\\n\\nFirst off, this is a pretty big meal for the price. It's a great lunch option for what you pay for. Having said that, it's not great. The rice was a little over-cooked, which I actually like, but some people may be put off by, especially with how sticky it was. The chicken itself was good, but also had been either cooked or sat under a heat lamp for too long. Damn the salmonella, I want my chicken cooked just enough to stop clucking!! The sauce was very good though, and really brought the meal together.\\n\\nOverall, it's a solid place for the price. I wouldn't go out of my way to go there when I am not downtown, but I am sure to head back during a busy lunch hour. Worth the visit\",\n",
       " u\"I'm so glad we have this Asian fast food place on Central Avenue, and near a light rail stop at that. Satisfying, generous fare (love their  sicky rice and the panko dishes!) served by friendly folk; a good number of dishes to choose from; good prices, very informal atmosphere, even a patio for alfresco dining. I feel happy supporting  a local independent business establishment, and even happier that this establishment serves tasty, very filling meals that are not a strain on the budget.\",\n",
       " u\"Hadn't been before but my fiance has been going for ages.  I had the coconut shrimp, very good and moderately priced.  Very friendly service.  It'll definitely be a place I consider in the future, especially if I'm using the light rail in the central Phoenix area.\",\n",

Which makes me really happy.\\n\\nI love when local business can do great!  They have always been great ,very friendly service and fresh food. The panko breaded items are light and feel healthy. All the vegetables I get here are  always crisp and fresh.\\nI guess it is because, they take pride in the place. Something you do not always see. I believe that they have lunch specials every week day.\\nHowever , they do charge extra for the little things. Like making it extra spicy is like .35 extra and brown rice is a little extra, I mean barley enough to where you would even notice.\\n\\nThey have soup, and sushi, salad,etc.\\nLots of nice cool drinks. If the weather is cooler(below 90) you can sit outside and enjoy the light rail going by.\\nWhich also means that you can take the light rail here as well.\\nIt is located in the same spot as always, right next to the Phoenix, Public Library.\\nWhen in downtown Phoenix, give it a try.',\n",

       " u'Im probably being so unfair with a rating of 3...Im not much of a sports bar girl.. but this place is fun.. and its a place to go pre-game.. have a few beers..and get into the moment...of testosterone... full of yelling guys.. and girls serving in sportsy shirts... not the friendliest girls either... so beer is cold... service way slow... my friend ordered a plate of chicken nachos... forever and ago...they finally arrive... are they okay.. yep, okay...do they rock? no...

       " u\"Despite the fact that since the day I learned to drive I was coming downtown for baseball games and now I live in downtown, I had no idea that Coach and Willie's is downtown!  Was I missing a lot?  Not really.  It is pretty decent though.\\n\\nI have no idea why we decided to come here, but I remember reading a lot of great things about the lobster bisque, and it was cold outside, so it sounded wonderful.  When we walked inside, a girl asked us what game we were there to watch.  She gave us the weirdest look when we told her we were just there to eat.  We seated ourselves and perused the menus for a good 10 minutes before she came back around.\\n\\nI ordered a cup of the lobster bisque and the crab cobb salad.  I guess I was going for a shellfish theme there.  The bisque came out first and was not what I expected.  I was thinking a smooth, fairly thin but creamy soup.  What I got was pretty thick and hot a lot of chunks of peppers and some good sized pieces of lobster.  It was good, but it must have been at the end of the pot, because it was just really strangely thick and it had a bit of a skin.  As a side note, I had a fresher serving of it at the State of Downtown Event and it was really fantastic.  My salad was pretty standard, but it was very large and filling.  I would possibly get it again.\\n\\nI may come back here again, but who knows.  They have lots of great TV's so it would be an awesome place to watch any game.  If they start playing MLS games, we may frequent this place a lot more in the future.\",\n",

       " u'My husband and I checked the place out for the first time on a First Friday (http://www.artlinkphoenix.com/alp/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=27) and were really impressed by the setup - the house right on the corner has a huge circular bar in front of it and the house on the left is the actual restaurant (with 4-5 tables in front for outdoor dining). The outdoor area was filled with people sipping drinks and waiting to be seated and the vibe felt really hip and urban, just like the artwalk taking place in the surrounding streets. \\n\\nThere was a wait for a table, so we put our name down. As many reviewers have already mentioned, the hostess isn\\'t particularly warm and is actually a bit snippy. I don\\'t think it makes the place seem more desirable if the staff is aloof and plays hard to get, but hey, maybe some people fall for that. We then walked over to get a drink at the bar. I tried the Pad Thai martini (a mix of lemongrass and basil, I think it was). It was strong, for sure, but for $12, I expected a slightly larger portion. The flavor was also really strong (very herbal) and not particularly tasty. \\n\\nWe were seated inside after about 20 minutes of waiting, which wasn\\'t too bad given how busy the area was for First Friday. Unfortunately, however, we were seated at this high, communal table - across from each other, but sandwiched (literally) between two other parties. We didn\\'t necessarily have a problem with this arrangement, but what did piss us off was how *ridiculously* uncomfortable the bar stools were. They were made out of this hard metal criss-cross material and literally dug into the backs of our thighs. My husband commented that they should have sat on them before they decided they would make sense for seating during a meal. On a positive note, the inside was decorated in this really cool urban-loft style and being so close to the kitchen created a really homey feel (although on this 110-degree night, we couldn\\'t \"stand the heat\" but couldn\\'t really \"get out of\" or away from the kitchen). \\n\\nOur server was friendly enough and the food was definitely decent. For our appetizer, we tried the Thai spring rolls - the rice paper was the right softness and the dipping sauce was awesome, but the rolls were literally stuffed with vermicelli and contained just one miniscule shrimp each. The entrees - the shrimp sesame salad and chicken Xa ho Fun noodles - were definitely good but nothing mindblowing. The veggie selection in the noodles seemed random and not necesarily well-thought-out. The sauce on the noodles was tasty and perfectly spicy, but there was too much of it, so the noodles got kind of soggy. The salad was also overdressed, and the dressing was too salty. However, the shrimp in the salad was amazing quality - we\\'ve had a lot of bad shrimp here in Phoenix, so this was a huge plus. To sum it up, for every positive we encountered in our food, there was a drawback. \\n \\nActually, now that I stop and think about it, the whole negative-for-every-positive thing kind of describes our whole experience at Fate. We loved the bar area but weren\\'t big fans of the drinks. We appreciated the cool vibe of waiting outside a house to be seated but weren\\'t thrilled with how inhospitable the hostess was. We thought the inside of the restaurant was well-presented but hated the imprints those horrible stools left on our thighs. We thought some aspects of the food were great but that others were sub-par. Didn\\'t love all of it, but didn\\'t hate all of it. Three stars.',\n",

       " u\"The Matador must be a Phoenix landmark for a reason. My guess is location, location, location. They've been serving better-than-average Mexican classics to hungry bankers, construction workers and sports fans for over 25 years. We've been here after games twice and I can say there is definitely better Mexican food out there. But the food was tasty -- especially the chips and hot salsa. On the down side, service is poor and the highlight of the dark, 70's decor is the kitschy matador mural on the wall.\",\n",
       " u\"My family have been going to Matador since before my parents were born! LOL! it's the truth! It used be the smallest little hole in the wall and is now a great place to eat when downtown.\\n\\nIt can be a bee-yotch in a half to find a parking space on the street so I always head straight for the garage. When you enter the doors, it's a large place from another time.\\n\\nAnd this is so because this place hasn't been redecorated since before I was born! I admit it's not the chicist place, but then again, pretentious places suck! But if you go, I insist on a booth near the window! It's a great feeling, so just sit and relax in the indirect light and munch on the free chips and salsa (which is BEST when the two salsas are mixed together with a light dash of salt! I prefer two parts mild to one part hot!)  cuz well... it might be a while before your server will come to take ur order!\\n\\nThe service isn't the greatest and I don't recommend going when in a rush. I particularlly like the combination dinner. You can any three out of several items with rice & beans. My fav is two beef tacos, cheese enchilada w/ rice & beans. :) Sometimes when i'm the mood for something different, I get the Greek Gyro platter! it's AMAZING!! I've only had gyros in two places, so i'm no inficianado, but it's still good!! \\n\\nI'd go in the late afternoon and early evening when it's not so busy. Avoid the lunchtime rush. Mix ur salsas and enjoy!!\",\n",

It was a delight. The meat was done perfectly and was very flavorful and not at all bland. Usually my rice goes uneaten, but this rice was about the best Mexican rice I've ever had. The beans were as I like them; full of cheese. \\n\\nThey have 2 sauces that come with the chips, one a chipotle, which I'm not a fan of, the other a spicy red which I slathered on top of my food.\\n\\nI'm sort of shocked at the low stars this place has gotten. My experience was grand and that's no bull! (Matador; bull; get it?)\",\n",

       " u\"I have been going to the Matador since I was in grade school. They have consistently good no-frills Mexican food and I much prefer it over the chain locations that are around. It's a nice large location downtown and has been renovated since many of the reviews on here were posted. Yes, the service has been slow from time to time over the years but I haven't ever had any more trouble here than at most other restaurants. It's a locally owned family business that has been in the family for over 30 years. If you're looking for something gourmet, then this is not your place. If you are looking for the Mexican version of comfort food, give it a try!\",\n",
       " u\"Atmosphere good.  Food...not so much.  I recently ate here for the first time and, unfortunately, I can't say anything good about the food.  I ordered a chicken shwarma sandwich and expected a hot middle eastern sandwich filled with flavorful chicken sauteed with onions and spices and accompanied with crisp fresh veggies.  What I got was FAR from what I expected.  The pita bread was your typical crappy faux Wendy's style doughy flat bread 'pita', not a regular pita pocket.  Inside was some flavorless, cold, unseasoned chicken (and when I say flavorless I mean indistinguisable from a mouthful of cardboard).  They didn't even bother to put basic salt and pepper on this sorry meat.  The remainder of the sandwich consisted of raw zuchinni (WTF?!), chopped tomatoes, 3 leaves of romaine lettuce, and some bits of red onion.  None of the veggies had been dressed or seasoned.  Oh, there was also some hummus/tahini 'sauce' mixed in there (presumably for flavor), but I have never tasted anything so flavorless.  I imagine that wall spackle has more flavor and pizazz than this 'sauce'.  Come on Paisley, does your cook even TASTE what comes out of the kitchen?  Add some flavor to your food.  You could start with salt, fresh lemon juice, garlic, pepper, and high quality olive oil.  It's really not that hard.\",\n",
       " u\"My experience was on a random Saturday afternoon, and I think that might skew my opinion a bit.\\n\\nDuring my visit we were the only guests dining.  There was one guy at the bar that was friends with the employees.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is mellow.  And I can imagine it being a pretty happening place on weekend evenings.\\n\\nThe prices were a bit high for what we ate.  I had a pita sandwich and it was just under $10.  The lunch prices are a bit steep.\\n\\nThe food was okay, but nothing I'd go back time and time again for.\",\n",
       " u'We freaking love Paisley Violin. Now, my five stars does not mean it is perfect, it has flaws that I will mention, but I do not believe your Phoenix experience is complete without a Friday or Saturday night visit to this lovely establishment. \\nThe first time we walked in it felt like Cheers, everyone said hello, the musicians, the bartenders, the bar patrons, as if we were old friends returning from a long trip. Now look, it isn\\'t pretty inside, it\\'s divey, a weird fish tank and ventriloquist doll are kind of strangely displayed, but look past that and see this place for what it is, a local joint with real honest to goodness people serving you. Good drink, great food, great music, great atmosphere, great service.\\nThe toasted pesto brie was delicious, the brie was not overpowering, and it complimented the pesto just right. Their vegetable stew was very good with huge chunks of vegetables and a hearty sauce, the peppered raspberry turkey is magic in your mouth, the royal is a wonderful sandwich with roast beef, mozzarella and garlic pepper and the venice violin, with soppressata, pepperoncini, balsamic vinegar and dijon mustard on a baguette is practically inspired. The desserts are good too, but not all house made, we destroyed the baklava, it\\'s highly recommended.\\nNow the bad, aside from the place being divey, which isn\\'t bad to me but I know it is to some, is that the parking is kind of a nightmare. Last I went I had to park in front of a very ghetto looking house with a guy cleaning his shotgun on the porch. Paisley Violin is not in a \"nice\" part of town, and with only a couple actual parking spots, you will be parking in a strange neighborhood in front of a stranger\\'s house... sorry. But it\\'s worth it, check with the Paisley Violin website and go on a night they have entertainment. \\nCheck this place out with a good friend and an open mind, we love it.',\n",

       " u\"This review is based on my experiences at various Hooters located all over the country and not necessarily at this one location. \\nIf you've been to one Hooters you've basically been to all of them, the only visible change is the quality of the scenery. Having said that, Hooters has still managed to become an American institution. As most should know by now the food here is one cut above average at best, my nephew once found remnants of a feather in his wings! TASTY DUH! Then again, I don't think anyone goes to Hooters for the food. I've always thought that Hooters could expand their beer line up quite a bit but that has yet to happen.  My primary motivation to go here is to set the mood for the rest of the evening, is that simple! Another reason is logistics, this is a good staging area for when your new in town and need to get a feel for where the action is.\\nI agree with Kimberly. Hooters is hooters. However I disagree with her rating! LOVE THIS PLACE!\",\n",
       " u\"I'm pissed. How can you just stop making grilled cheese? Its bread and cheese. HOW? You have bread, and you have cheese, but you cannot make a grilled cheese?\\n\\nAlso, why does it have to be 400 degrees? I know you have A.C. This is AZ in the summer. It's hot. Turn it on.\\n\\nI don't have a really good basis to draw this conclusion because I rarely order this drink, but your dirty vodka martini is quite possibly the worst I have ever tasted. I had to eat a cheese stick with each bite just to stomach it.\\n\\nYour tater tots were good and my blue moon was reasonably priced. At least you have that going for you.\",\n",
       " u\"Okay, so it's a Hooters - how can you not have fun with it?  Granted, my expectations weren't super high, I've been to other locations and they've always been consistent.  And sure enough - the Arizona Center location did not disappoint.\\n\\nWe were in a group of about twelve, and we all ordered beers and food before going to a movie.  Service was great - (reading other reviews - we may have just been lucky) but seriously everyone was friendly and prompt.  We had multiple servers helping us since our party was large.  My fiance and I ordered a couple of beers (domestics of course, but we made do) and their famous wings.  I ordered two that were the hottest level of spice they came in.  Honestly - they weren't hot at all to me but my fiance must constantly remind me of my lack of taste buds (I recently took on the infamous ghost chili and won - but that is a story for another time).  Everyone at the table thought they were spicy, so order with caution.  We ordered them Daytona style - which means they were grilled - and they were yummy. \\n\\nThe girls were of course pretty!  ;)  They even sang happy bday to our two buddies - who had the biggest smiles on their faces EVER!\\n\\nThe negative to this particular Hooters is the location itself.  The Arizona Center becomes a ghost town at night - and parking in the lot is tricky.  Even with validation you still have to pay after a certain amount of time passes.  Maybe I'm just spoiled - but when I go out to dinner or a bar I don't like having to pay for parking.  It's not like we're in New York or San Francisco!  \\n\\nRegardless - parking issues aside - a really fun time with a good group of friends.  A good spot to hit before a movie or another bar!\",\n",
       " u\"Possibly the worse service ever. I love their wings but for this simple experience, I will never go to Hooters again. Went there for the zombie walk and ordered wings and food. \\nMy party and I finished eating our food and the wings had not even come out. I had to ask for them twice and the last time I asked for them to go. I didn't even get to eat them at the restaurant. Worst of all no one apologized for the delay or for anything. Possibly the worse service ever. I will never ever go to a Hooters again. I can find better wings and service else where. So if you want to eat good wings and bad service then go for it. Should of been a zero star rating.\",\n",

For dinner I ended up with the spaghetti with meat sauce, dinner salad with Balsamic vinigrette dressing and it was tasty!  Date got a cheese pasta dish, and he said it was to cheesy.  O well.\\n\\nAnyways, place and service was fine, will be back, and I still love it here!',\n",
       " u'This should have been a better experience... \\n\\nI\\'ll begin with the food.  We arrived on a Sunday afternoon after a visit to the Phoenix Art Museum.  We ordered a BLT salad off the lunch menu and a manicotti dish.  We also included a cup of the minestrone soup for a buck.  The salad was good and was accompanied by fresh, hot bread.  The minestrone soup was outstanding.  The salad and soup were brought out early, as we requested, and we had ample time to complete the salad before our entree arrived.  The manicotti was fine and a good enough portion size that we had to box some.   So far, a good dining experience.\\n\\nThen the bill arrives.  The salad was 8.50 and then entree was full price.  We questioned the bill, as the \"lunch menu\" said the salad would be 5.99 and the entree 1.50 off.  The server actually apologizes and says he\\'ll have the manager correct the mistake.  Then he comes back and tells us \"Sorry, manager says lunch prices only apply Mon-Fri\".  Nowhere on the menu does it say lunch only applies Monday through Friday, and we were never told.  I didn\\'t press the issue, paid the bill and off we go.  \\n\\nWhat could have been an overall pleasant experience ruined by what is essentially a sham.  Giving patrons a menu with lunch specials and prices and then waiting to mention \"that doesn\\'t apply\" until the bill arrives disgraceful.  Deceptive business practices will trump decent food every time, hence the two-stars.',\n",

They were not busy at all for a Saturday night.  The staff were friendly enough, but a little too casual.  In my opinion this is no longer a fine dining destination but a pit stop for pasta.  The restaurant has lost its class. \\nThe food was a huge let down.  It was very bland and way over priced for the portions served.  \\n\\nWe wont be going back\",\n",

Always good motivation.',\n",
       " u\"I was suprisingly displeased this time around. It was my 2nd time there and it wasn't anything like I remembered. The salad was DRENCHED in dressing (which I hate) so if you don't like that, get your dressing on the side. All I ordered was the soup and salad lunch special. They brought me my first salad which consisted of, literally, maybe 11 pieces of iceberg lettuce, 3 slivers of carrots, 4 slivers of cabbage, and about 8oz of dressing!! absolutely disappointing. I ordered my second salad with the dressing on the side and, of course, they brought me a REAL-SIZE salad the 2nd time. They should have done that the first time. The service was slow as hell and they brought us 2 loaves of bread (bc we had a party of 7) with only 1 knife. It was retarded all around. Just about everyone else was dissatisfied with their meals. It was lunch hour, I'll give them that....but they weren't even busy!!! Never going there again :(\",\n",

       " u'Wow..what a waste. Starting with the menus I should have known it was going to turn out to be a horrible meal, raggedy and dirty that they were. THe color on everything that we were served was off and pale. The salads were pathetic and everything needed salt, its amazing what a dash will do to cheeses. The meals were touted as hearty and fulfilling, but its been a long time since Ive seen my husband clear his plate, which is either a good thing or bad thing i feel it was sadly mislead..I was so disappointed but at very least I didnt feel bad about not taking off my running jacket before dinner, this may be the blue plate headQuarters and home of the $10 bowl of pasta, but if your looking for class and/or quality pass....

       " u\"I've seen this place downtown for years and finally went for a work-related holiday lunch with a party of 10.  Now I've heard rave reviews for years, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed with the food.  The server was friendly and efficient, and though we waited a bit for our food, they kept the hot bread coming, which was quite tasty.   I had the Italian Sausage sandwich.  It was a few small pieces of sausage, average flavor, on what looked and tasted like a somewhat large hotdog bun that had been on the counter for a while.  I was still hungry afterwards.  Now, I can go to a deli and get a bigger sausage sub with way more sausage for the same price and end up taking half home for later.  I will say that it was not at all expensive and that combined with the decent service is why I gave 3 stars.\",\n",
       " u\"This is a decent sized chain with great food, but what get's me every time is the extremely sensational atmosphere. This location has so much too look at you'll definitely find your eyes wandering as you eat, either in admiration or just trying to figure out what the heck that thing is over there!\",\n",
       " u\"Great place, friendly people, very cool old house turned into a restaurant. The server was not all there, he must have been new. I asked him three times for lemon for water, took him twice to bring a Corona, and he not once checked up on us after our main courses were served to see how the food was. That leads to this, because I was waiting ever so patiently for him to come back and ask - my pasta was very dry, not much sauce on it. I wanted to see if I could have another side of sauce but it seriously took him so long to come back I ended up just eating it. It was a good dish, I'm trying to check the menu right now but it's not showing up. It was veruceli (sp?) pasta, the spiciest on the menu, which I would give it a 6/10 for spicyness. Good place though with decent prices!\",\n",
       " u\"Stay as far away as you can from this place.  I have been twice and both times both of our entrees were cold.  The last time I came I should have known I was going to have a bad experience by the fact that the kitchen manager and floor manager were chit chatting on the floor the entire time I was there.  I ordered the Breast of Chicken Fettuccine.  It was possibly the worst pasta dish I have ever had.  The chicken was so dry I could not eat it.  It tasted like it was either boiled, reheated or a little of both.  The cold stale pasta and sauce did little to compliment it, so I picked the broccoli out and that was that.  I wonder how they are teaching servers nowadays because when I was still in the industry and two plates looked untouched we were taught to inquire about what was wrong.  I did not feel the need to complain because as I stated before the manager was obviously too busy hanging out nonchalantly to care about my awful dish.  I would stay away unless you are just of the greedy type that don't mind stale pasta because they will give you a heaping serving for around $10.\",\n",
       " u\"I have been going here since I was a little girl! Lately, the service hasn't been great but still love The Manager's Favorite and good prices.\\nToday, we ordered the appetizer Burger Sliders- what came was 1 meatball on a bun. We sent it back being there was nothing on it (caramelized onions) and confused cause it didn't mention meatball, just was supposed to be burger sliders like anyplace you order. We flagged down a manager and him and our server brought back with onions, but insisted that's how it's supposed to be. When leaving, we mention to a different manager (Stefan) and he totally agreed with us. There's a new menu coming, but still not excusable that what we got was definitely not BURGER sliders (no matter how much the other manager,server, and hostess was trying to convince us meatballs are basically the same thing!) Stefan took care of us with offering to give us our money back and a coupon for next time. He saved this trip from us not wanting to come back!\",\n",

Generally I find that if the veggie burger is good, the normal is bad and vise versa. However, both were terrible.

Both look to provide healthy food options in a market of fast food and grease. The problem is that, despite My Florist's problems, it is local, more diverse, and doesn't make you feel like you are eating in an Ikea showroom.\\n\\nThe food is just bad. My chicken sandwich was dry. Drier than the Mohave dry. I'm trying not to dive into other forms of hyperbole but this chicken was born and raised inside a Popiel Food Dehydrator. The least they could do would be to provide me with some mayo to fix things up a bit.\\n\\nThere's another one of these over on Camelback, it may or may not be better, but as far as our downtown one goes, this place will never see me or my money again.\",\n",

Dad said his soup was pretty good & ate 1 of my roll-ups, said it was pretty good but kinda bland in flavor. I thought the roll-ups were pretty good too & agree that they needed a lil extra somethin. I didn't eat the chips but the pasta salad was very yummy. For both meals & 2 drinks, I think it was less than $20.

At someone's suggestion, I ordered the chicken roll ups and they were alright. The chicken and the onions were good, but I think maybe the cheese or something in there made them taste just slightly off. Anyway, it was good, but I wouldn't run over there to get it.

I used to have a problem where I'd get home and find chicken added to it (a no-no for a vegetarian like me), but I haven't had that issue in about a year.  Nonetheless, I check it while I'm still there every time to make sure.  The salad is big and tasty (especially without those nasty olives or unnecessary potato salad glob at the bottom), and I feel like it's pretty healthy and low calorie.  The service is nice and pretty efficient, even during weekday lunch rush when it's a real challenge to find parking and maneuver around the lot without getting hit.  They don't even embarrass me about coming so often and ordering the same exact thing, haha.  The one thing I can say as a critique- they could be a bit more consistent on their salads.  Sometimes there is a ton of something, like lettuce or feta, and other times it's challenging to find it at all.  This place is solid.\",\n",

Take it with a grain of salt because I'm not like a huge BBQ buff at all, but I seriously don't think it tastes much better than ribs from say, Chili's or some chain resteraunt. BBQ sauce is BBQ sauce to me. It tastes the same as Kraft BBQ sauce from the bottle.\",\n",
       " u'Came to this location a few years ago and haven\\'t been back since. It wasn\\'t that it was \"bad,\" it\\'s just that, as far as the nationwide spectrum of barbecue goes, this is just not that good. But, for whatever reason, Arizona is just a tough place in which to get good barbecue.\\nIt\\'s a busy corner, now (wasn\\'t when I was there) right in front of the light rail in a decidedly office area. So, the lunch crowd is heavy. The place looks like it used to be a taco, cheesesteak or other fast food joint and had minimal renovations done. It\\'s small and gets pretty crowded.\\nI got a brisket sandwich, which is sort of my own litmus test when it comes to BBQ. Prices were about what I would expect to pay. IIRC, my sandwich was about $6-7. Sides were extra.\\nThe sandwich was okay. The brisket had a nice flavor, but wasn\\'t fabulous, and I didn\\'t think a whole lot of the sauce which, to me, is really the best part of good barbecue (although I know it\\'s not pure barbecue).\\nBut, regardless, this is still the best BBQ I\\'ve found in Phoenix. There used to be a place in Tempe called Big City, which was just fabulous. But they moved out to Mesa and went out of business near the beginning of the year. So we\\'re left with a bit of a void and, now, you can find better BBQ at random festivals from booths, and even here in Tucson. But, if I\\'m really craving a great brisket or a spectacular slab or ribs or a plump, perfect sausage, I have to head east to Texas. There\\'s just no comparison.',\n",
       " u\"Hands down my favorite BBQ sauce.  Dreamy.   I always order the pulled pork or chicken sandwich and halfway through I ditch the bread to get closer to the delicious meat and sauce.  :) \\nAlso, this is my go-to for catering office events.  They're super professional and I always get glowing reviews from my customers.\",\n",
       " u'The food is always great. Very good BBQ Pork that has plenty of smokey flavor and the sauce compliments it well.\\n\\nThe employees on the other hand have a terrible attitude and never smile. They never say \"thank you\". I definitely recommend going to the Van Buren location because this one does not make you feel appreciated for your business.\\n\\nI would have given them lower if I didn\\'t know what their true standards are from my consistent patronage at the other locations.',\n",
       " u\"Me and a friend stopped in here one night maybe 10 or 15 minutes before they closed. We had been in the mood for some good BBQ, but have no idea where the good BBQ places in Phoenix are at, so we thought we would just give it a try since we were starved. \\n\\nThis was the first BBQ I had since I moved to AZ, and remains the last place I've had BBQ at (I've been pinching my pennies lately, and BBQ is generally pretty pricey!)\\n\\nAll in all, I'd say this place was pretty good. I contemplated a pulled pork sandwich, though I've heard nasty stories about people who've consumed undercooked pork, so I decided to feel the place out with beef first. It was terrific, and I wish I would have went with the pork! came with fries too and they were excellent. \\n\\nI didn't know what to expect coming in so close to closing time, but I was very happy I stopped in. I do look forward to stopping by again when I'm in the area.\\n\\nSince I havent tried any other bbq in Phoenix, I really can't compare honey bears to anything else. But overall, I was pretty satisfied.\",\n",

       " u\"Only Eastern North Carolina BBQ gets five stars, but for Phoenix this is really good. I stopped here for dinner after work and before an appointment. I got there at a good time, because a line formed after I got my food. I enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich, and the mac 'n' cheese was creamy with just a touch of pepper that added a bit of zap. The sauce on the sandwich was good as well. \\n\\nI wish they had a pulled BBQ plate option with a couple of sides, but I didn't see that (unless I missed it). The sandwich was good, though -- I'll be back!\",\n",
       " u\"Pretty good BBQ for Phoenix!  I enjoyed the pulled pork sandwich with a side of mac 'n cheese...quite tasty!  The atmosphere is not very appealing and the advertising is quite cheesy, but guess it did make me laugh!\",\n",
       " u\"Good wholesome BBQ, but they were out of collard greens :-( The cornbread muffins weren't the best either, but the brisket and cowboy beans are worth coming for.\",\n",
       " u'Average food that is way overpriced. For the price the portions were small the taste average and after sitting in the waiting room of a nearby hospital for days we were looking forward to some taste and comfort food. Not!!! old and dirty room, and not good home flavor.',\n",
       " u'Came in to order a barbecue feast to eat and watch game 7, however, there was not enough meat left in this joint to order a feast:(. The biggest disappointment is that I completed a huge order just to have another employee come from the kitchen and tell me, \"Sorry we don\\'t have x,y, and z.\" So since the bbq joint had no bbq, I ordered a hot link sandwich and left. The sandwich was average, the service was quasi-average, and the organization of this restaurant was well below average. I\\'m hesitant to return.',\n",

Went on a Saturday morning and it wasn't too busy.\\n\\nI ordered the half rack of ribs ($13.99) which came with six rib bones and two sides (I got sweet potato fries and coleslaw).  The ribs were tender and the fries were delicious.  The coleslaw, eaten by my fiance, was just okay.  He got the pulled pork sandwich ($5.99) and enjoyed it.  It was messy but good he said.  We shared a drink and wound up only having an additional $4 and change to pay on our bill.\\n\\nThis was a yummy lunch and the groupon made it even more awesome.  Worth a visit!\",\n",
       " u\"My husband and I love the ribs and the pulled meat sandwich trio. Their BBQ sauce is great. My husband has told me that fridays are rib tip day but they are always out when we get there. My negative would be that we Sally do to go orders and three times they've messed it up and that they're always out f rib tips on Friday.\",\n",
       " u\"Came in on a Saturday evening to answer a pregnancy craving for the wife. Placed order at 5:41 and didn't get our order until after 7. The BBQ isn't that amazing especially compared to other places in the valley. While we were there three people elected to get refunds rather than wait for their order to be filled. When they asked for an explanation regarding the wait the guy up front shrugged his shoulders and apologized. \\n\\nAgain it's not mind blowing food and will definitely look elsewhere for BBQ before coming here in the future.\",\n",
       " u'I just went here for dinner with my gf and a friend using a couple of Groupons we had. I\\'ve also had it recommended to me by a few people previously. \\n\\nLocation: It\\'s like any other place on Central- the location itself isn\\'t that sketchy but everything around it is. The inside is a pretty standard Mom-and-Pop simple decor. Dining area was pretty clean and employees were walking around regularly to make sure it stayed that way. Trashcans had those annoying small-circle opening tops on them and made discarding your refuse without getting crud from previously discarded trash on your hands a task. Men\\'s bathroom was cramped but clean. \\n\\nFood: I had the brisket, pulled pork, and Cowbro\\' beans. Brisket was alright; I\\'ve had better and I\\'ve had worse. It could\\'ve used a bit more smoking/more intense smoking but the sauce complemented it well. Pulled pork was good- about on par with any other decent pulled pork. It had a nice balance of flavor between the meat and smoke and was also complemented well by the sauce. The sauce is a low-viscosity variety with a great balance of sweet and spicy. The sweetness was just enough to draw out some extra meaty flavors in the brisket and pork without overpowering it. The spiciness was just enough to complement the other flavors, keep the taste-buds excited, but not too spicy by any means. The Cowbro\\' beans were actually pretty amazing. They seemed like a standard canned-base with other seasonings added, which made them taste infinitely better than canned. The beans also had chunks of smoked sausage in them, which I felt was a nice touch. The sausage had good flavor and a crisp casing. \\n\\nMy girlfriend had a pulled pork sandwich, ribs, and mac n\\' cheese. She thought the ribs were \"alright,\" a fairly standard rib. She enjoyed the mac n\\' cheese and was too full to touch the sandwich so it came home with us. \\n\\nMy friend had the chicken sandwich, mac n\\' cheese, and peach cobbler. She thought the chicken sandwich tasted good but was a little dry (and it did look a bit dry from across the table). She thought the mac n\\' cheese was alright but that she\\'d had much better. She enjoyed the cobbler but felt the filling was oddly watery and regretted not ordering it a la mode. \\n\\nStaff: Friendly, attentive. \\n\\nSummary: If I\\'m in the mood for barbecue, it will certainly be on my list of places to go to if I happen to be in the mood to drive to Central.',\n",
       " u\"Been wanting to try Honey Bear's for a while, was planning to go visit Town Talk ll. But since I start work at 5:00am, and take lunch around 10:00 - 10:30. Town Talk doesn't open until 11:00, and Honey Bear's opens at 10:00! Honey Bear's sits right next to another of my favorites(Best of Philly). \\nWhen you walk in, there's a counter right in front of you. Menu is a little confusing, but just tell them what you want. Even though it was lunch, I had a half slab of pork ribs with potato salad. Their ribs are probably my second or third favorite ribs I have eaten. Ribs have a lot of meat, very good smoke taste, not the tenderest ribs I have had but nothing wrong with it. Potato salad was very good also, little different from what I am use to. \\nPrice wise is about what is expected for ribs. Half slab of ribs(meaty), potato salad, order of fries, plus a drink. for about $20.00\\nVery happy with my meal, will diffidently come back.\",\n",

       " u'Tried a mac \\'n cheese \"flight\" this past Tuesday, 4/21.  One serving costs $8, or a trio $10.  I chose blue cheese, pancetta and caramelized red onion, and butternut squash.  I favored the blue cheese for huge flavor and the pancetta and onion for lovely texture.  The butternut was alright- mildly sweet and I did like it for nibbling.  At the very least, it was my veggie portion of the meal!  I thought the presentation could\\'ve been better; I can appreciate the rustic look- one really cannot control how the cheeses will boil and spew in the oven... Well, have a look at the photos and tell me what you think!  I did witness another table receive a \"better-looking\" trio of ramekins, of what I don\\'t know, so perhaps she chose a different set from what I\\'d ordered.\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hU6sN5r6vayqm_RMgvPGOQ?select=4f5Y0561dLrB-69S0lH6GQ\\n\\nLoved the section of lemon tarte I had for dessert!  Awesome buttery shortbread with a well of lemon curd, then topped with a fresh lemon slice.  I did notice that my tarte slice was cracked in a couple of places;  Thought it \"clever\" of the server to hand the dish to me with the lemon slice neatly covering up the defects...  Still a great-tasting dessert, though- it\\'s a must-try if you like lemons or buttery shortbread!\\n\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hU6sN5r6vayqm_RMgvPGOQ?select=Y6gF0oMs3bwU8vjC7Kymsg',\n",
       " u\"I have to give this place 5-stars. The cheese plates are small and everything is a bit pricey, but I feel it's well worth it. Windows surround the building to the east and north. You can gaze out on Central Avenue and watch passers-by, cars and the light rail. The area suggests Phoenix is coming of age into a more distinctive urban area, rather than its notorious sprawling suburban-esque cityscape. It's in a gentrifying neighborhood that's quickly becoming a more artistic, upscale part of town. They have a lengthy wine and cheese list, the latter offering suggested wine pairings (if you're embarrassed to ask the server.) However, some pairings not suggested may surprise you. The last time I went I was a bit disappointed that my favorite wine they sell (Duck Pond) is only available by the bottle. The cheeses are good, though I've learned from experience to try a small taste of some before taking a larger bite, and I haven't heard of most of them before going here. I enjoy the Nearly Naked Theatre company, which performs at the neighboring Phoenix Art Museum, and always stop in here for a bit of wine and cheese prior to showtime.\",\n",
       " u'As Gabi likes to regularly point out to me, I did move over a year ago and I am closer to Cheuvront.  I suppose it is time for an update.\\n\\nMy initial review of 5 stars has not changed.  Not every visit to Cheuvront has been a 5 star visit, but over time I have come to know what dishes and wines that I prefer.   I am a frequent visitor to Cheuvront because I like the atmosphere it provides within the downtown area and it takes less than 5 minutes for me to walk there.  It provides a relaxed environment where you can enjoy wine or a cocktail and order food based upon how what you are in the mood for.  A full dinner? Sure.  Just dessert? You got it.  A small nosh? Why not.   I find myself here most often for small plates and cheese, very rarely do I have a \"regular\" entree.  It is not to say that they aren\\'t good, they are and they are quite large, I just enjoy the variety of the menu.  \\n\\nMy favorite time of year at Cheuvront is the fall, as I think that their best dishes involve traditional fall ingredients such as butter nut squash and pumpkin.  This is also my favorite time to partake in their extensive cheese list.  Their international plates, while may seem expensive at first glance, are literally overflowing with cheese and meats.  Happy Hour can be a fun time, although I am personally not a fan of many of the mixed cocktails that they feature.  This works out just fine, as the wine list has many choices that I am happy to order at 25% off.  The $5 tapas offered during HH are great compliments, my favorites being the gnocchi, ceviche, and the mac and cheese.  (Really, any of their mac and cheese options are great). \\n\\nThe relaxed atmosphere and consistent food and service have made Cheuvront into one of my favorite places in Phoenix, and possibly my favorite place downtown.',\n",
       " u\"This is the place to come if you love cheese. They have a cheese selection as long as some wine lists. We went for lunch on Friday and it was not too busy.   I had the Summer Salad with chicken, apples, grapes, pecans and blue cheese toast which was good but with way too much greens and the toast was a tad soggy. Mr had Cheuvront Dip, sliced beef on a baguette with au jus and a two giant portions of fries, one sweet potato the other regular.   The baguette, beef,  au jus and sweet potato fries were great, the regular fries were nothing special and a little cold but we got two huge portions instead of one so we couldn't complain.   The place has easy parking and our waitress was very friendly.   We will be going back for Phoenix's first cheese and wine tasting event next week.\",\n",
       " u\"3.5 stars. Hmm, Cheuvront. You have me scratching my head. You have all the makings of a fantastic spot, but I think I may have caught you on at a bad time! It was first Friday in Phoenix the night I visited, so perhaps that was it.\\n\\nHere's the good: Extensive wine list, my bubbly was absolutely delicious, simple but comfortable surroundings, thumbs-up to the semi-private sitting areas in the back, your restrooms are good for a laugh (although they are unisex, I seemed to always be in there with all men, which is fine, but please remember to lock your doors!) Also, our host acted as our server - not sure if this is typical or just because they were slammed, but you could tell he was working his butt off. \\n\\nThe so-so: The prices seemed pretty steep to me. I don't mind an expensive meal if the food is stupendous, but there seemed to be a few missteps. Two of our appetizers were overcooked (overbaked, to be precise) with scant filling. Also, I ordered a scallop appetizer as my meal because I didn't want to commit to an entree. They weren't able to make it, so I ordered the scallop entree and was only able to eat 2 of the scallops, which were sandy, and a small bit of the pasta. It felt kind of  wasteful.\\n\\nOh! Our meat and cheese plate was tasty, but beware: those long thin strips in the middle of the plate? Butter. Not Cheese. ;)\",\n",
       " u\"So great! I was there for an event last week and we had a blast. The event was handles perfectly! Can't wait to go back!\",\n",
       " u\"I love Cheuvronts and have been going there regularly for years. Why only three stars then? Over the past year and a half the service has gone downhill. I find that the servers are impersonal and rigid, and sometimes a little pompous. After three or four bad experiences in a row I just don't go there anymore. They do have great cheese plates and a fantastic happy hour...just don't catch them when they have a special event going on.\",\n",
       " u\"I live on top of Cheuvront. Literally.\\n\\nThe good: they sell wine at retail, when I find my cellar is down to those o-so-expensive bottles that are to be savored for a special occasion, it's great that I can pop downstairs and pickup a bottle for 1/2 off the in-store price. They also have a great patio overlooking Central ave, library and light rail and are dog friendly. My dog once escaped from the dog-run area of our building, a feat that involved scaling a 6-foot fence (still baffled) and after a quick search around voila- there she was, meeting and greeting guests on Cheuvront's patio!\\n\\nFrom a food standpoint, I agree with many here the portion sizes are not the biggest however most of what they do is consistently well executed. Being a pizza snob, pizza here is not something I do when there are a lot of other choices downtown. I do like the filet mignon, usually two medallion sized pieces with pommes frites\\n\\nMost of the time it's a plate of various cheeses, nuts, grapes and some bread. I often request them to toast the bread for me, the majority of the time it happens without too much whining.\\n\\nBOTTOM LINE: I'll take convenience over value\",\n",
       " u'Snippy waitress. Ran out of bruschetta and caprece salad. Caesar salad was warm shredded lettuce (apparently including iceberg) and tomatoes with some sort of non garlic dressing that was barely able to be tasted. That is not a Caesar salad.  Flatbread came without being cut into manageable slices and crumbled all over the place. Was told the bruschetta would have been made on facacio ??? bread  if they had any. That is not bruschetta.  My companions ordered shared salad and flatbread which arrived without sharing plates.  The kitchen was slow and the wait staff insufferable. The chef is obviously very high on himself.  I was embarrassed to have taken my visiting relative there.',\n",
       " u\"Few things make me happier than wine and cheese -- so naturally, I enjoyed the Cheuvront! I wasn't in the mood to make any decisions myself (it was Friday, after all) so I let one of the owners surprise me with his favorite red wine and a cheese plate. The shiraz he picked was delish, and the cheese plate, especially the brie, was equally yummy. I'd suggest you go for happy hour, sit on one of the comfy couches, ask your server or an owner for their recommendations, and try a bunch of stuff!\",\n",
       " u'I just had to go here to check out a place owned by Alice Cooper.  I ended up getting a meal that was good and gulped it down with a nice beer. A bit dark but hey, its a place for rock stars.  Try to avoid going there where there are major events at the stadium- the streets can get nasty.',\n",
       " u'i think the food is pretty good and a nice place for lunch since they are pretty quick and have alot tables to sit at.  they have great happy hour specials... and the best part is that all the servers have that really freaky eye makeup...',\n",
       " u\"I really liked Cooper'sTown!  Yes, everyone who works there has to wear goofy eyeliner which is somewhat cheesy, but they were all also quite efficient and pretty entertaining.  \\n\\nWe went when it was very busy right before the baseball game, and were seated in about 20 min (after they told us 45min).  The food is ridiculously unhealthy, but SO GOOD.  Best bar food I've had in a long time.  We had the white trash nachos (frito pie), I had the pulled pork sandwich and he had the chili burger.  YUM!  We were craving more deliciousness after the game, so we came back and ate more.  Little disappointed that more game-goers didn't party at the bars after - kind of weird.  Since they are a block from the park.  Ah well, I guess there's no place like Chicago.\",\n",
       " u\"ACT is a fun place to go, maybe not the most fun place to go, but certainly a worthy effort and enjoyable.  The names of the food items play tribute to the local sports scene and such which is cool.

       " u'The girl and I stopped in here when we were in town after seeing this place on Bourdain\\'s episode of the American Southwest.\\n\\nI didn\\'t know what to expect, nor did I care. I just wanted to order the \"Big Unit\". A two foot hot dog that comes with it\\'s own flashing siren and regal announcement of \"Big Unit!!\" from the waitress as it\\'s brought out to you. The locals must be use to this, because I don\\'t think they stirred a bit.\\n\\nFor something that I thought would be a novelty menu item, the Big Unit was actually a pretty tasty hot dog. It\\'s all-beef, poking out between a sweet and tasty but not overwhelming bun. (HAH!) Add some simple cheese sauce to the top of it and you\\'ve got a meal and an afternoon\\'s worth of snacking.\\n\\nThe ambiance? Big and clean. Nothing uniquely  \"rock star\" about it, save the guitars and album covers neatly arranged on the wall and the service dolled up like Cooper in his heyday. But really, who cares? From what I could tell it\\'s got good food, plenty of gigantic tv\\'s, and waitresses who are more than happy to bring us tourists two feet of ballpark goodness.',\n",
       " u'Another one of the places we hit up on a pub crawl night.  Like most downtown venues, it depends on what\\'s going on down there to how busy they are, but I\\'ve never been disappointed.  Even when it\\'s completely dead, the staff is friendly and nice.  The bar staff all seems knowledgeable, and was really willing to help us as we drank through the alphabet - I think it was their suggestion that for \"H\" we try a Harvey Wallbanger....\\n\\nThe only advice I have, is don\\'t let your drunk friend wander off by himself.  If you walk into the kitchen when looking for the bathroom, they very nicely escort you out.',\n",
       " u\"We had a good meal here before the game. The hot wings with the house sauce on them were very good, and I had the mac & cheese. That was good too. My dad liked the chili, and even got a cup of milk to go with it. Oh, the french fries are good too. \\n\\nThe guy on the patio played Desperado as we were leaving. It's a family favorite song, so that was a nice touch.\\n\\nThen we went to the D-Backs game and watched the Brewers win by one run. I'm not from Phoenix and don't live there either, so I really didn't care. The stadium is nice, though.\",\n",
       " u'I give Cooperstown a five star - based on their pricing alone.  I ate lunch with 2 kids and our bill was $30 with tip.  The food is nothing fancy - just delicious and refreshing on a hot day.  The girls said their chicken fingers and mac and cheese was good and I really enjoyed the Ty Cobb Salad.  Also, love the giant glasses of iced tea.  \\n\\nThe service was attentive and quick for being so busy.  Neat place to go overall.',\n",
       " u'This is the greatest restaurant I\\'ve ever been to.  But I love rock music.  If you hate rock music and baseball and you have no sense of humor, you probably won\\'t get as much of a kick out of this place as we always do.  We ALWAYS go here when we\\'re in Phoenix.  Good food, awesome decor and quirky menu choices like \"Wings of Mass Destruction\" and \"Megadeth Meatloaf.\"',\n",
       " u\"Before going to a Suns game, we walked over to this restaurant to try the Big Unit hotdog.  We had the signature Man vs. food Big Unit hot dog and it was big.  My buddy and I split it in half and we both agreed that we could have eaten more and most likely have finished it.  There's nothing glorious about the hotdog other than it was big and it was covered with all of the toppings.  \\nThis restaurant is just like a Hard Rock restaurant.  Most of the servers there wore makeup like Alice Cooper...that was pretty cool.\",\n",
       " u'We stopped here before a D-Backs game on a Saturday afternoon. We liked the idea of the baseball theme before a game and the dual reference of Alices last name and the home of baseball\\'s hall of fame was not lost on us. All around you are the double references of rock and sport. On the wall are signed guitars, in the lobby is a basketball floor and actual backboard from the Suns. Large and spacious with many places to eat. Brick warehouse feel.\\n\\nOur server was friendly and attentive. All the servers sport a small version alices trademark \"black tear\" eyes. I ordered a Kurt Warner Reuben ($9.99) and my wife ordered the BBQ platter sampler ($13.99). The menu has lots of fun names for it\\'s fare.\\n\\n Our food arrived in what seemed to be 2 minutes. The fastest I\\'ve ever experienced. This is a jeans and beer place. Your food will come in a basket lined with paper -- diner style. My sandwich was piled high with tender corned beef and toasted to perfection. The fries were crispy and hot. The slaw was crispy and fresh. The BBQ platter was delish and will definitely take a couple days to eat. Washed it all down with a draft Blue Moon. Often, celebrity-themed restarants have much to be desired on the food front -- overpriced for what you get -- but we were pleasantly surprised. \\n\\nOnce in a while the classic rock music background is punctuated by a ringing school bell and everyone shouts \"The Big Unit!\" which signals that someone has ordered the signature monster hot dog as featured on Man vs. Food on the Travel Channel.\\n\\nOverall a fun good time. Good place to bring visitors. We were here on a Saturday afternoon but I\\'ll bet this place rocks at night on the big outdoor patio.',\n",
       " u\"This place is a lot of fun as a result of the atmosphere and pleasant wait staff!  The menu rocks a combination of vegetarian items, low carb items, and greasy guilty pleasures.\\n\\nThe only problem is that it may be difficult to locate parking during peak hours, especially when a sporting event is taking place.\\n\\nDoes anyone know how frequently Mr. Cooper makes appearances in his restaurant?  I'm just curious...\",\n",
       " u\"Went here because of Man vs Food.  Nice place to have a Beer and watch sports or just hang out.  But, the food, that is another story.  My daughter had the fish tacos.  They where like Libby TV dinner style fish sticks no taste.  My wife had the Cheeseburger, again no taste and not any better that a Bob's Big boy burger.  I had the hot wings, they where OK, and the nachos where like High school football game nachos.  Our waitress always acted like she was being bothered.  All in All, I tried this place for food and I will not be going back or recommend to anyone I know.  Drinks only OK!!!  2 words describes this place:  Tourist Trap.\",\n",
       " u'The food here is not particularly good, nor bad enough to make it stand out, other than its enormous hot-dog, \"the big unit\".

So the unit had a lot of flavors but it wasn\\'t too hot, but it was still great and I can finally say I tried it.\\n\\nAlso got a side of fried zucchini which was amazing as well, the marinara sauce it came with was really wet though, but the ranch the provided was good enough for me. I probably don\\'t need to come in again for the loaded unit, but what I saw other people ordering made my mouth water, everything looks delicious!

       " u'Welcome to Alice\\'s overpriced tourist trap nightmare! Food is expensive and totally tasteless. Seemed like they used generic frozen ingredients for all the dishes we ordered. The fish fry and fish tacos were the worst. Seriously, $13 for 3 skimpy, dry pieces of fried fish? C\\'mon! The \"Mike Myers\" sandwich was just OK, but not really worth it. If you\\'re a fan, grab a beer and check the memorabilia on the walls, but better get your grub somewhere else.',\n",
       " u\"Lets just say this place is awesome! My sister in law ordered that huge ol' hot dog and shared it with 3 different people. I had a bbq chicken salad and it was pretty good and a very decent size. I wanted to take the cup home that they served our drinks it!  It is a fun place to work out and if your kids are scared of dark make up I would definitely steer clear of this place!!! But fun place to just enjoy a good lunch/drink or two!\",\n",
       " u\"Some of the best food I've ever had! Came here last year for spring training with my girlfriend, buddy, and my little brother and it was so fun. We watched the NCAA tourny on all the big screens and their food is so good. My lil bro got those huge hot dogs. Good memories to look back on.\",\n",

I was shocked!!! Yes, we all had out share of it. But my Aunt Sue was game and actually ate most of it!! I had the Rob Zombie Burger! It was great, cheese burger with guac, salsa, and bacon!! All had a great time, and yes again, we will be back!!',\n",
       " u\"The good wasn't spectacular, my party shared the big unit hot dog. They really need to put a lot more chili on it. We had the jalapeno coins appetizer, they were delicious. The place was slightly run down. But overall, we had a good time.\",\n",

       " u\"I've been here twice so I'll review both.  The first time there was a Tool concert at US Airways that night so this place was packed.  (Is Tool in a similar music genre to Alice Cooper?  I don't know.  Anyway...)  the wait for a table was long, but luckily bar outside served food and the line moved faster than I thought it would.  We ordered the Wildcat sampler and it was delish.  Their fries are and potato skins are crispy and flavorful.  Also, their prices are not bad.\\n\\nOur second visit was on a Friday night.  Wasn't too busy, which made me happy.  Plus, our waitress was attentive and friendly.  The Mac and cheese was more like a penne with Alfredo sauce, but whatevs.  The food is all around satisfying and I'm definitely making Alice Cooperstown a regular place on my list.\",\n",
       " u\"I hadn't been to a T.G.I. Fridays in years before I heard about this place on a recent trip to Phoenix.  It's located inside Chase Field, where the Arizona Diamondbacks play, but it has its own separate entry so you don't need a ticket to the game to get in here during a game. You can, however, see into the park from much of the restaurant. This was cool.\\n\\nThe place looks like any other Fridays, but a little nicer. It has a lot of baseball decor on the walls instead of the typical Fridays bric-a-brac and large TVs to watch games on. Plus, it has large windows that let you see into the park. You can't see the field from many of the seats, but looking in at the crown is fun. \\n\\nI was looking forward to stopping at a T.G.I. Fridays to try some of the food featured on that Food Network show, but during games they have a limited menu that excludes a lot of the good stuff including most if not all of the Food network recipes. That was kind of a bummer. \\n\\nOn the plus side, the food we got was good. It was hot. The service was good and friendly. The beer was cold. We could see into Chase Field.\\n\\nThe server tells me that you can make reservations for the tables outside in the park and inside by the windows for a reasonable price, and half of that price is credited in food. It doesn't seem like a bad deal, and would be worth checking out for a game or an off night, especially for an avid baseball fan.\",\n",
       " u\"We decided to take our son here for dinner on his last night in town because the boy loves baseball. We were a little bummed that everything inside the stadium was dark so we could not really see the field. We were able to go out into the stadium itself on the restaurant patio which in itself was pretty cool.\\n\\nThe food here was actually quite good. I had the Jack Daniels flat iron steak and it was awesome. My hubby had the JD Burger not complaints either. To drink I had the BFM (Best Friday's Margarita) which was $10..total waste. Not only did it have a strange taste, but very weak. Next time I will just stick with an ice cold beer.\\n\\nOverall we had a nice time and while the drinks were a little spendy I think the food prices were about average.\",\n",
       " u\"Horrible experience. Go in for happy hour with my dad at 4:45 and sit at the bar. No one else is there, not their fault but still weird. All the bottles of alcohol are still covered with paper cups, the beer taps are still wrapped and plugged, and the 10 staff are all hovered in the corner. No reason the place is empty!!!!!!! Got our nachos wrong but surprisingly the burger was amazing.\\n\\nOnly reason this gets 2 stars is it's connected to the baseball stadium.\\n\\nP.s: prepare to pay for parking too! We risked the ticket and got lucky on the meters after it expired\",\n",
       " u\"This review is for the service (or complete lack of, I should say), not the food because we never got that far. We are visiting for Spring Training and thought this would be a fun place to take the kids. What a joke. The place was not busy at all. Empty tables everywhere. Still we are told it is going to be a 20 min wait. When I question the hostess about this, she tells me it might not be that long but they need to get some tables cleared off. There were other people around looking equally as irritated as we were. We enjoyed checking out the field, took some cool pictures and finally asked the manager 25 min later when we might be seated. His response was that he would seat us as soon as he could, but he didn't want to seat us and not have us get served. We experienced the only positive thing this place has going for it (location, picture opportunities) and got the hell out of there. Completely lame.\",\n",
       " u'Do not order the chicken nachos.  Awful!!!',\n",
       " u\"I read the reviews on here, so I was excited to try this place especially since it's so close to my house.   After eating there once, I doubt that I will ever go again.  I always judge a Mexican restaurant by the beans, and theirs didn't taste good.  I ordered the machaca (shredded beef with onions, bell peppers and tomatoes) tacos.  They came without any cheese.  WHAT?!?!?  How can you give me a taco without cheese!  The meat was OK but the taco itself was very greasy.  My husband ordered two enchiladas, one machaca and one chicken.  He liked the machaca but took two bites of his chicken and didn't like it.  I have to admit their horchata (rice milk drink) was good and a good size.  I know there's better Mexican food out there, so I'll keep searching...\",\n",
       " u\"Rostias Place is the best Mexican food place in Phoenix.  They have amazing machaca and the salsa's are always great.  Sometime's the salsa's and chile are so hot I fear my stomach might explode, but in a good way. It doesn't get any better than Rosita's.\",\n",
       " u\"Great food!  Service was quick and staff was nice!  Very authentic mexican food and some of the best tamales I've had!  Definitely try the green tamales!\",\n",
       " u\"Don't let the seedy location fool ya, this place is the bomb, serving up some of the most authentic Mexican I've ever tasted.\\n\\nYour experience will begin with parking in the rear of the place. As you make the long walk to the front entrance, you'll disregard any conversation with others in your party as you worry whether or not your car will be there after dinner. It will and here's why.\\n\\nAs you make your way to the front of the parking lot, you'll notice an old Mexican man, (actually a cliche or sorts, complete with sombrero and serape) sitting, vigilantly keeping an eye on your vehicle and everyone else's. \\nThis should calm you down, enough so that you're able to re-join the conversation. Now get inside and get ready for a cold Mexican beer and a pitcher of Margaritas. \\n\\nTheir chips are gratis and served warm. A nice treat,. They offer red salsa, hot sauce, and tomatillo green sauce which is spectacularly hot.\\n\\nEvery item on their menu is delicious, but my preference is either the Machaca burrito, or the Chicken Mole. Their mole sauce is off the charts good. Not too much chocolate, not too much chile, just right. \\n\\nWhat I really love is the black and white photos of old Mexican bandits, governors, rabble rousers, war hero, ex-Presidents and others. \\n\\nHere's my suggestion.\\nGo on a weeknight when they're not busy. In this way, you can make your way around the room and get a close up look at the images, which in my opinion are worth a look,.\\n\\nThe food, ambiance, service are all superb. \\nThis is the place where I take out-of towner's when they say they want 'real' Mexican food. \\nThis is also the place where your butt-hole will curse you the next day if you don't listen to him and ease up on the salsa.\",\n",
       " u'Listen this is true old school Mexican cooking.  If your on a Diet stick with water with lemon or leave it at the door pick it up on the way out.  We eat here all the time but today was the bomb so good their green mix all green enchilada style OH MAN ITS GOOD staff is always very friendly the owners and her family are very accommodating their menudo is some of the best and not to many restaurants have good menudo this place is very good and you get a lot for your money affordable',\n",
       " u\"Pros:  Chips, salsas, beans, green chili, BIG tacos, great prices/value.\\n\\nCons:  Ground beef was mush, rice was meh.\\n\\nBottom line:    In my longstanding quest to find a go-to Mexican joint in central Phoenix, Rosita's emerges as a leading contender.   \\n\\nThe chips are made fresh to order ($1 for a big basket) and go great with the salsas, and even better with a side of beans.  About the beans:  they're as good as advertised, with a salty/creamy (but not textureless) combo that's bliss.  Too bad the rice was so ordinary and bland.  But no one has big expectations for Mexican style rice, so only a small knock here.\\n\\nThe green chili burro ($5, additional $3 for beans and rice) is top notch, near Rito's in quality, but with a better construction.  Tender and spicy and not too soupy to soak through the tortilla.  Generous portion, too. \\n\\nFor kicks I also ordered a crunchy taco with ground beef and potato.  On the good side, it was BIG for $2.60, and full of goodies, lots of cheese and a good but not excessive helping of lettuce.  Good value.  On the downside, the flavor and texture were very disappointing.  They blended the beef and potatoes together to make it a pasty mix.  Not appetizing at all.\\n\\nMy friend got a chicken taco and enchilada and said the chicken was particularly flavorful and tasted like it was braised, which is uncommon in a town where most Mexican places boil and shred their chicken.\\n\\nThe atmosphere inside is perfectly respectable for this kind of restaurant.  The neighborhood isn't great, but it's a well lit parking lot and there's an attendant watching the premises and the parking lot.  So there's that.\",\n",

       " u'Whataburgers are rapidly disappearing around here which I think is too bad as I like their food.  And they have used the fast casual approach in their dining room decades before the label.  They have always been good at preparing it with your choice of toppings and you can get a side of gravy for your fries.\\n\\nThis particular morning I was driving a bit of a different route and wanted a breakfast sandwich of some sort for a snack.  I spotted this store and got a breakfast biscuit with sausage, egg and cheese.  It came out quickly and it was indeed a good snack.  Of particular note was the biscuit itself was not old or crunchy.\\n\\nThis one I rounded up from 3.5 just because.',\n",

Don't judge me ;)\\n\\nI did try their Taquito with Sausage & Cheese. It was actually good. I asked for both the red and green salsa so I could taste test and see which I liked best. The red salsa won by a landslide.\\n\\nThe service at this location is always top notch. Friendly and professional.\",\n",
       " u\"24/7 hours = good\\n\\nHowever, they rarely get my order right and by the time I get home I don't feel like driving back after a long day the office or school, even though it IS the closest location to my house. They always re-read my order to me to verify it's accuracy but then they put it on the burger anyways (Mustard when I ask for NO mustard, once they added random mayo to my burger, and once they left out my pickles) Now what's a burger with no pickles.\\n\\nThe shakes are always very runny compared to the location on 3rd Ave and Indian School. That location is the one I go to now because this location can never seem to get it right, even after a number of second, third and fourth chances.\\n\\nI love me some Whataburger but will no longer be visiting THIS location.\",\n",
       " u'I get double meat, double cheese, plain and dry medium meal. Everyone there is pretty friendly. Food is my favorite for fast food!! My burger is SOOOOOOO good. The fries are hit and miss. Sometimes they are hot and fresh and amazing. Sometimes they are cold and soggy.',\n",
       " u\"Fresh. Convenient. Cheap. And I'm not talking about me as a date. It's That's A Wrap! Or It's A Wrap. Or Wraps N Things. Not sure, but me likey! I've only had one thing and it was the turkey wrap with cream cheese and strawberry preserves in a whole wheat tortilla. Dee lish! Side pasta dish was, well, your basic cold side pasta dish. The day we were there, the room was luke warm at best. No A/C! Almost made me want to run for the hills. But we got it to go and enjoyed it at home. Besides the customers who were there were stinky teenagers with pants hanging at their knees, bad posture and sad, sulky little faces. Oh, puberty!\",\n",
       " u\"Been here twice now and I really like this place!  Great healthy choices for lunch and it is not that expensive.  Both times I have come I have had the My Sherry A'more it is grilled chicken, white onions, button mushrooms, and fresh baby spinach sauteed in a robust sherry sauce, with diced roma tomatoes, jasmine rice, and feta cheese wrapped in a tomato basil tortilla... YUMMY!  This is going to be one of my regular lunch places now.  Also they have a strawberry lemonade that I am sipping right now that is so refreshing!\",\n",
       " u\"When I saw that this place was rated four stars overall, I thought that was perfect. This is a workhorse of a lunch place. Never bad, a diverse enough menu to allow it to be enjoyed frequently without getting bored of it. I seem to be in a Very Brady Clubster rut recently but really everything on the menu is great. I would say that the wraps are about a dollar too much, but you do get a side with them. \\n\\nCan't really delve into too much more right now because I'm on my way to pick up my lunch there right now.\",\n",

       " u'Its refreshing to find one-of-a-kind places -- God knows Phoenix needs more of them to inject personality into this generic, strip-mall, chains-on-every-corner valley. Finding this unique sandwich shop, which is in a house that has been transformed into a restaurant, is indeed a welcome find. The real estate is limited, so parking is compact and circles around the back of the building.\\n\\nThe dining area is mainly indoors, but there is also a small patio facing the back portion of the parking lot, which is not very scenic. Inside there is art on the wall that can be purchased.\\n\\nThey serve wraps, bowls and salads. The food has been pretty good, although it did not knock my socks off. I ordered the Baja Bowl, which is described on their online menu as \"Southwestern chicken atop garlic rice, black beans, Monterey jack cheese and topped with lime sour cream and pico de gallo.\" It was OK, but the chicken was dry and cut in fairly large chunks. It could have possibly been microwaved -- not sure, but there were no southwest flavors to speak of. I have done a better job of cooking chicken on my George Foreman grill at home. Perhaps the garlic rice would have helped with the flavor, but I had substituted the rice with organic brown rice which did little to add flavor. Sour cream was not \"lime\". There was a small slice of lime served on the edge of the bowl. I would not bother ordering this again -- especially if I have a craving for some southwest food.\\n\\nOn another recent visit I ordered a wrap called \"Prince of Thai\\'s - Spicy peanut chicken with baby spinach, garlic rice, fresh ginger slaw, cucumber pico and red onion wrapped in a spinach tortilla.\" That had better flavor than the baja bowl. Vegetable ingredients were fresh and good. Again, I was not very impressed with the chicken chunks.\\n\\nOne thing I think That\\'s A Wrap needs to address is the use of styrafoam cups. Afterall their slogan is \"Healthy Food for a Hungry Planet\" and they have a link for a new restaurant \"Green\" for Vegan food on their website. For such an artsy, earthy place, I would have thought That\\'s A Wrap would have made more conscious, earth-friendly choices. For that reason and the bland chicken, I give them an average rating only.',\n",
       " u'The food was ok, but there is no parking and the lunch wait is looong. its also pretty healthy eats which is not too exciting',\n",
       " u'I love walking here for sunday afternoon meals. I will spend the morning usually having a few beers and watching football or whatever sport is on, then around 2pm or so I go over for some of their off the grill chicken that they do in the parking lot. Couple that with some warm tortillas, their salsa bar, homemade horchata, and a dessert pastery from the panaderia, and I am in heaven. On normal days when the grill is not outside, the food is ok, and most of the items in the market/butcher shop scare the bejebus out of me. It is not anywhere near \"authentic mexican\" (if you see a burrito or a chimi in mexico, its there to make americans feel comfortable) but it is palatable.',\n",
       " u'I agree with all these posts.  cheap, colorful, huge menu, good horchata, tres leches cake at the panaderia....\\n\\nNot much more has to be emphasized, however, one reccommendation: get the ELOTE along with whatever you decide to get.  Its corn on a stick covered in mayo and queso- delicioso.  if you really want a treat, squirt ketchup all over it too.  mmmm market foooood',\n",
       " u'Looking for counter service, tasty Mexican food? This is it. Excellent tacos, burritos and combination plates. Extensive menu. Try the al pastor anything; superb.\\n\\nPlus, this place is a gigantic bakery with terrific sweets and cakes.',\n",

       " u\"So, whenever you have a California gurl in a Mexican Restaurant, it has to be good.  My weary tummy has not had anything substantial all day, and having read the best of the best about the amazing La Tolteca, I decided to let me feet hit the street & check out this local flor in the rough.  Well, I have to say the reviews are all TRUTH.  \\nThe green enchilada's were my choice as I've not ever been huge fan of the red sauce, in addition to a full range of all that one could feast your immediate appetite too, there is also fresh tortillas, candy, the bakery which is a temptation I did avoid (thank you P90X) and yes, I did say it, the temptation is the BAKERY,  the smells hit your nose before you even step in, yeast, sugar and spices, La Raza!  \\nEnjoy your time, don't rush, I wandered around and grabbed my favorite Fanta to connect the true flavors of home, Cali and my youth, thanks for the great time La Tolteca, and you'd better be sure that I'll be stopping in again with re-inforcements.   \\nGracias & Happy Eating\",\n",
       " u'With so many places to eat Mexican food in Phoenix, this is my absolute favorite for Mexican casual dining. The staff is friendly and remembered me the 2nd time I ever came in, and every time since.  The ambiance and decor is fun and the food - oh the food is amazing!  I have brought several people here who doubted my claim of \"best in Phoenix\" and they all left agreeing with me.\\n\\nI confess that I tend to stick to a few favorites and always over-order, but it\\'s all so tasty!  Their super nachos are much more \"super\" if you put carne asada on them instead of the standard ground beef.  I had never had elotes con todos (corn with everything) before coming here, but somehow, steamed corn on a stick with mayo, chili powder and cheese is a winning combination. Who knew?  There is no way to eat this corn daintily but it\\'s so good that I don\\'t care.  I can floss later.\\n\\nThe carne asada or carnitas soft tacos are consistently high quality but the real reason I pilgrimage here from clear across town is the fish tacos.  The mahi mahi is perfectly seasoned and flaky, with homemade tartar sauce and queso fresco.  I personally skip the rice and beans because they do use lard in the beans and that doesn\\'t always sit well with me.  The salsa verde from the always well stocked salsa bar is noteworthy and good on nearly everything and just a few drops of habanero salsa on my fish taco is enough for great flavor and a little kick without totally setting my insides on fire. If you like ceviche, try the tostada de ceviche - a great little value for the price - shrimp, avocado, onion, tomato and lime for under $3?  I couldn\\'t make it for that cheap!\\n\\nThe latest development at La Tolteca is the construction of an outdoor BBQ grill just outside the entrance closest to the parking lot. Perhaps this will reduce smokiness inside from the somewhat poorly ventilated indoor grill.  That would be great.\\n\\nBefore you leave, be sure to pick up some churros and a fruit empanada or two, or even some arroz con leche (rice pudding) at the panaderia (bakery). Even if you (like me) ordered too much and don\\'t have any room left for sweets, they\\'re just as good as a late-night snack once you get home.',\n",
       " u\"If you don't like La Tolteca, just go to Taco Bell for the rest of your life, because you obviously don't enjoy food. Your eating privileges should be revoked, in fact. \\n THIS IS MY FAVORITE Mexican place in the ENTIRE COUNTRY, and if you look through my reviews, it's quite obvious that Mexican food is my #1 reason to live. The menu selection is HUGE. My favorites are: The Shrimp Tacos.. SO GOOD. Big hot corn tortillas, with gigantic grilled spicy shrimp, red & green bell pepper, and onions. Their Chile Rellenos are simply the best I've ever had.. They are egg dipped, stuffed with perfectly melted cheese, and the peppers are huge, spicy and ROASTED. *dies* YES. None of that soggy baby food tasting relleno you may find elsewhere. This is the real deal! Papas taco is great, Elotes are awesome, etc etc.. The only let down has been the Fish taco.. it's just kinda dull.. but why eat that when there are the OMFG FALL OVER SO GOOD shrimp tacos. Also the environment is unique, festive, and cheery, and the staff are great too.. the owner is a doll.. I just love her :D Before I forget.. THE SALSA BAR.. Absolutely the best salsa in Phoenix, and if you can't deal with heat, then go cry about it somewhere else.. There are several types and styles ranging from mild to BURN YER TONGUE OFF, and there are also roasted chiles and that marinated trio of carrots, cauliflour and something else I can't remember right now :P  I'm not even going to start about the desserts, cuz they speak for themselves..\",\n",
       " u\"La Tolteca is Restaurant/Bakery/Market and sells the best authentic Mexican food I've ever had in the states.  The atmosphere is fast paced/to-go style and there isn't a thing on the menu that isn't to die for!  No need to get dressed up, just sit back, get messy, and enjoy!\",\n",
       " u\"They messed up our orders, they took forever, and the place is a little dirty. It's my belief that a restaurant or business should never express their political views, which this restaurant has failed at (signage). It was nothing too special. Tortilla's were good! But that's not enough to bring me back.\",\n",
       " u\"It's a restaurant, it's a bakery, it's a market, it's Laaaa Tolteca! \\n\\nThis place is fun, the restaurant has been around for years and the quality of food is still solid. The dishes are mainly authentic, you order at the counter and seat yourself in a huge dining room. It is not always the cleanest place but it is easy to find a table. I love the salsa bar, so many choices and pickled veggies. I love anything pollo grilled, and the carne asada (yes not the best in town) is flavorful and juicy. \\n\\nGrab a horchata, order your meal and go by some dirt cheap pastries while you wait.\",\n",

       " u\"I tried Gourmet House of Hong Kong today with a group of co-workers. I'll admit I may be a bit jaded as I would have preferred a place with a patio to take in this beautiful day, but whatever.  Yes the decor sucks, it's dark inside, and the restaurant is laid out weird...but it's those things that give this place it's charm.  The menu is huge...potentially the largest menu I have seen at a Chinese restaurant.  Service was quick and we had ordered, ate and had the check in like 30 minutes. Of course, since we were in no rush to go back to the office, we sat around and talked for another 35 minutes.\\n\\nThe lunch specials are cheap. Like $5 or under cheap. The portions are also a reasonable size, so it's a good deal for $5.  The corn soup was...interesting to say the least. Not something that I enjoyed at all.  I had the cashew chicken as my meal (it's not on the lunch special menu)...large portion, tender chicken, and lots of cashews. I didn't care for the light sauce very much actually and was disappointed when there were no green peppers in the dish. Also, the carrots tasted a bit off to me.  My co-workers all enjoyed their dishes, which included sweet and sour chicken and peking duck.  The bill for the five of us (including tip) was $40. So an awesome deal, considering two people can't even eat at TGI Friday's for $40 anymore.\\n\\nCan't say I will be running back to Gourmet House of Hong Kong, but not a place I would avoid either.\",\n",
       " u\"The food is blah. I ate there for a long time just because it is the closest Asian restaurant, but really the food could be better.... OK, it could be a lot better. A long time ago, I used to love their frog legs, but now they are so bad I cant even tell you. The abundance of sauce ruined the crispiness of the frog legs. I was so disappointed!\\n\\nThey raised their prices by 50% or more on some dishes & sides. Some of the prices have almost doubled. For example, the small rice was $1. Now, it's $1.50 extra. The large was $2. Now, it's $3.50.  It is something stupid but still annoying.\\n\\nAlso, it is hard to order food from them over the phone... To tell you the truth I sometimes have trouble ordering food from them there because they dont seem to be able to communicate very well in English. And you always have to double check your order.\\n\\nThe food is inconsistent.  It's not great but it's food and still fairly inexpensive. I wont bother eating there again because their food keeps getting worse & worse. I have had 2 friends get sick from their food. Watch out for their chicken! My friend said he got undercooked chicken from this place.\\n\\nAlso, They wont give out copies of their to-go menu with the new prices on it. So you kinda just have to take their word for it on the new prices... It used to be a place we went often but it's getting to the point that I'm kinda just over this place.\\n\\nYah, the more I think about it, I'm way over this place.\",\n",

I go here mostly for the noodles, the tofu dishes I've had have been merely ok.  My partner enjoys the sweet and sour pork and kung pao chicken.  If I could do 1/2 stars, I would give Hong Kong House 3 1/2 stars overall - for this review, 3 is too harsh - so 5 stars for the noodles and fast service and the convenience.\",\n",
       " u\"Until recently I have been a long time patron of what may have been the finest Chinese eating establishment in Arizona. There were many memories made here. I moved away several years ago which made it difficult to get back to one of my all time favorite restaurants. Recently between appointments I found myself at lunch time both hungry and near this landmark. I was unaware of the ownership change until I walked in and was not greeted by familiar or friendly service. \\n\\nSince I was on limited time I ordered from the lunch menu expecting the the same service as I had been accustomed. Wrong. The order was taken in reasonable time but the food arrived luke warm almost 35 minutes later as I was preparing to leave. The lunch special wasn't very special and bordered on disgusting. Running late for my appointment, I had to track down staff so that I could get a guest check and pay my bill. I can say that both service and food quality were consistent: SUB PAR. It is unlikely I will return.\",\n",
       " u'This is my uncle\\'s favorite Chinese place in Phoenix...and I have no idea why.\\n\\nIt\\'s a little junk Chinese food spot...but it begs the question: \"Isn\\'t Junk Chinese at least supposed to taste good?\"\\n\\nI mean, I know what I\\'m putting into my body isn\\'t actually good for me, but Gourmet House of Hong Kong makes the act of eating it not even pleasurable...so what exactly is the point?\\n\\nThe spot isn\\'t very clean (the bathroom=complete ew).  The noodles are gummy, the tofu is rubbery...The sweet and sour sauce was kind of good, but I think it added to my stomach ache (which began mid meal).\\n\\nThe crunchy things they\\'ll give you if you ask--those are good.\\n\\nCrunchy things and a semi-doable sweet and sour do not a restaurant going experience make.',\n",
       " u\"I would like to make my rating based on three things: Food quality, customer service and consistency. I've tried MANY asian food establishments here in the valley since moving here three years ago and this is by far the best I've had! I usually order To Go and my food is always ready before I get there and am greeted with a kind hello and an appreciative smile (how nice!). I've ordered from them many times and have been impressed everytime. Thank you for the great food!!\",\n",

I highly recommend the Chow Fun, the Hunan Beef, ginger and green onion snapper (fried)...\\n\\nThis is one of my favorite spots. \\n\\nUpdated:\\n\\nWe have been visiting this place once or twice a week and we are still loving it.

Turns out they decided not to and now are going to open a second one in the not too distant future.\\n\\nI am so sad that I came here on the last day that this little diner will be open.  I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine who is a regular patron.  It was a nice Saturday afternoon so we ate outside and I think the little diner (with 8 seats) was full.  I had a single patty cheeseburger and the favorite and a coke.  The favorite is fresh cut fries with peppers, onions and a few other things that made this a delicious side dish.  It was all soooo good... I am glad I had the opportunity to try it.',\n",
       " u'Big thumbs up for this place. Great spot for burgers and dogs!',\n",
       " u'The people are really cool.  Excellent food made from local ingredients. The chicken biscuit sandwich is yummy. Also, must indulge in the poutine. Fun place with lots of misters running over the picnic tables outside which kept us cool. Must check this place out for yourself.',\n",
       " u\"I go to Welcome Diner so much at this point, I feel like making up disguises. It's like, c'mon, I'm JUST trying eat here everyday of my life and not feel embarrassed about it. \\n\\nThe thing is, they make the best everything I've ever had anywhere.\\n\\nThe Bleu Burger? Omg. The Peanut Butter Bacon Burger? Literally so good, I'm pretty sure I lost IQ points. The Biscuit Sandwiches? I want to be in a Facebook-official relationship with one.\\n\\nJust go here - you will understand and you will not regret it. Actually, you might regret it, because you tend to go.. no where else afterwards. Just start trying your disguises on now.\\n\\nReal complaint: They only do breakfast on weekends, doesn't start till 10:30am.\\nMore real complaint: They won't let me move in.\",\n",

       " u\"I trekked all the way to this place from the Convention Center.  I was a little unsure if I was headed to the right place, since Welcome Diner is located in a neighborhood, but I'm so glad that I found it.  My food was delicious and the staff seemed genuinely friendly and interested in how I thought that the food was, which is always the sign of a good chef.  I did have to wait a little bit, but I didn't mind too much, since it's a small establishment.  People should be forewarned that there is very limited seating indoors and that most of the seating is outdoors on the patio.  I personally thought that it was nice to sit outside, especially with the mural on painted on the fence/wall, but I understand that it might not be so comfortable to sit outside at the picnic tables in extremely hot Phoenix weather, especially if it was a busy day and you had to share a bench/table with a bunch of people you don't know.\\n\\nI got a fried green tomato sandwich on sourdough with house-made corn salsa and arugula.  It was fantastically delicious.  The ingredients were fresh and everything from the toasting of the bread to the battering of the tomatoes was well-executed.  Although the sandwich was filling and came with a slice of cantaloupe, I wish that it had come with some sort of side, like home-made potato chips, for the price.  Alongside my sandwich, I had a tasty Four Peaks stout.\",\n",
       " u\"THIS PLACE is great. I love this joint. The staff is awesome and the food is great. Their grilled cheese is so good. I also love their beer selection and their full bar. I have a hard time decided what to order when I go here because everything looks so good. This place is tucked away and can easily be passed up, but don't make that mistake. I love it here.\",\n",
       " u'It was a really cool environment and unique from the vast majority of the Phoenix area. We enjoyed their commitment to fresh and quality ingredients. Everything we ordered was delicious and reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly and prompt. \\n\\nHIghly recommend to come after dark in the summer because it is so blazing hot (mostly outdoor seating). We will definitely be returning for more pulled pork fries!',\n",
       " u\"My fianc\\xe9 came here for a late anniversary dinner around midnight. I ordered a special burger they had called the Jose I believe and my fianc\\xe9 ordered the Carol. We both absolutely LOVED our food. The burger I ordered had a jalapeno relish with onions and it was just amazing. The Carol was also really delicious and unlike any other pulled pork sandwich we had ever eaten. The staff was very friendly and it was lit cutely with string lights. We are so happy to have a late night spot to dine in Phoenix that's not a fast food restaurant. I absolutely love this place and we will definitely be back!\",\n",
       " u\"Wow my friend found them on yelp what amazing food had welcome burger excellent.   Also had the corn dog appetizers wow the ladies I was with said it's the best hurricane they have ever had.  Great job guys a definite go to location for everyone. ..\",\n",
       " u\"Ahhhh! The best burger I think I've had! (the champion?) This place has redeemed my first impression of Phoenix! My beloved and I were just passing through. Phoenix was hot (really hot), congested, and filled with erratic drivers, leading to stress and grumpiness. The Welcome Cafe took us in with open arms. Awesome food, awesome drinks, awesome people. We laughed and joked with everyone at the bar like they were family. We'd be here at least once a week if we lived here. Well Done!!\",\n",
       " u\"white people dash into the grocery store to pick up a bottle of chard to go with their olive garden take-out, mexicans go to the grocery store to shop, eat some food, buy some bootleg cd's and see their cousin at the checkstand and make a day out of it. PHXRNCHMRKT embodies this tradition and so much more. the entire left side of this megastore is like 15 excellent restaurants all smashed together. after you order your food, walk to the jugeria (spanish for jugeria) and order a large horchata mixed with strawberry.\",\n",
       " u\"Well, it's probably all been said and been done about this place. Today I finally made the trip inside the store, rather than just going to the restaurant on the side. It was too early for lunch at Tradiciones so in I went. I knew that the market had a lot going on at all times; I nearly run down at least 6 people getting in and out of the parking lot and I'm a really good driver (seriously-not Raymond from Rain Man good, but actually good!). The parking lot on the store side is always packed.\\n\\nSo the focus of my trip was the cucina. It was bustling for lunch already at just 10:30. So as I'm trying to make sense of the menus posted in both Spanish and English on the wall above the hot food line or whatever, I am greeted by a nice woman that helps me decide where to go. She mentioned sopes first, so that's what I started with.\\n\\nMy order was way too much food for one, but I wanted to try a couple of things. So I got both a chicken and a steak sopa, a street taco al pastor (pork), and a side of beans. They did have combos unlike another reviewer said but I only wanted to add beans an opted for a side instead. My total for food was $11.00. Not super cheap, but like I said more food than I would normally order at once.  \\n\\nSo a sope for those unfamilar is not a torta as someone else said. It's more like a weird tostada or open faced sandwich. The base is somewhere between a corn tortilla and an all out bread. It does appear to be flash fried to cook but I'm not totally sure and it didn't feel greasy. The sides are curved to make a small cup to fill with beans, meat of choice, topped with shredded lettuce, grated cojita cheese (I'd describe Mexican parm--hard salty and good!!) The chicken and steak were both tasty. The steak was a little strung together if you will. I'd rather have seen it be chopped better so I would be easier to eat smaller bites. If your teeth didn't make it through that bite, a big chunk was coming along with it. Sorta messy but good though I felt like my sopa was a bit tougher than it should be and my extra cheap plastic fork would bend to the will of the sope.\\n\\nThe street taco was just so I could taste the al pastor. Two tiny corn tortillas topped with a bit of pork. I topped it with onions and cilantro and would totally eat the al pastor in another dish. \\n\\nBeans. Not a really a fan. They lacked the taste of say Carolina's beans though the texture matched. A disappointment. \\n\\nSalsa bar was good. Hot green and red, and the pico was spicy too. Fresh onions and chopped cilantro are a must so it was good to have those. \\n\\nAgua Fresca...Just love it. I had the fresh guava juice. So tasty and well worth the additional $2.91 I spent for the 32oz drink. \\n\\nTotal food and drink, $13.91. A little spendy for lunch served in stryo while seated on a bench, but it was fun and I will order a little differently next time so it won't be as expensive and I won't order more food than I can eat.\\n\\nMarket, looks good. Great looking bakery (really), meat counter, tortilla factory, etc. I'll probably not go out of my way to get there for things I can buy at Food City on a regular day. This does look like a fun way to go get some lunch before you shop for dinner on a weekend. I'll definitely take others for hot food and a fun people watching experience, plus pick up a few goods on the way. \\n\\nI don't really know about authentic. It's probably not. I don't really care. My dad's family is from near the Mexican border and though I've been to mercados in Mexico and even here, I liked that this place is busy and clean. Campy, sure. But like I care!\",\n",
       " u\"Ranch Market rocks!  I swear, this is the coolest place, it's like a big Mexican circus.  I could hang out in there for hours.\\n\\nThe best deal that I've found there is the roasted chicken.  For about five dollars, you get a whole roasted chicken, some tortillas, and some salsa.  Buy a little cheese, an onion, and some sour cream and you've got yourself a little taco bar to take home and eat with some Dos Equis.  Sweet!  Since I'm all about the bargains these days, this is one of the best places to go!\\n\\nA definite five stars as far as I'm concerned!\",\n",
       " u'So this review is probably a little biased (cuz shopping here reminds me of the awesome time i lived in Oaxaca, Mexico), but still; teee-rust me, Ranch Market is full of life and great produce and makes grocery shopping just a lil more fun:) \\nI usually make sure I go on Wednesdays where produce is ridiculously cheap...like 7 kiwi\\'s for a dollar or 9lbs for a dollar watermelon...I\\'m not gonna lie, I have posted my receipts on the fridge with pride...these are my \"A\" graded school papers of adulthood. The only issue is that when I come home with a trunk full of fresh fruit and veggies that cost me $8 I slowly realize I have to actually store and eventually eat all of the produce I just bought. I hear Thursdays are the days to buy meat for cheap--but my fridge is usually busting with pineapple and strawberries by that point and there isn\\'t room for an ounce of carne asada. \\nlong story short, be prepared to weave through the masses on Wednesday mornings for some great finds. The rest of the market is fabulous as well. The \"Tradiciones\" restaurant serves excellent--and cheap (shocker) authentic Mexican food. Plus they also have an aisle with cooking supplies (like giant blue pots, tortilla presses, molinillos etc) and a whole wall of spices. \\nenjoy:)',\n",
       " u\"4 1/2 STARS\\n\\nWhat can I say? This is an amazing place. It's a 100% large Mexican supermarket. It has a huge variety of all products including fresh fish, meat & produce.\\n\\nYou can also eat there, which we happily did. At the deli, we had a ceviche tostada and a fish taco for $4. The ceviche was delicious, although the fish in the taco wasn't cooked through.\\n\\nThen we walked by the bigger, better food counter & couldn't resist the tacos there, which were fabulous.\\n\\nOnly demerits here are for sloppy, haphazard service & the undercooked fish taco.\\n\\nA great place...\",\n",
       " u\"This is where I shop for fruit and veggies since our Farmer's Market is less than stellar. (Good effort, though, but my heart belongs to the one in Hillcrest) The prices are great-the best of any local grocer. Added bonus...who doesn't want to enjoy some ceviche while they shop?!\",\n",
       " u\"I've been here a couple times now for lunch, and seriously, this is some of the BEST mexican cuisine in The Valley. The experience alone of going here is worth the visit. The price of a meal; super inexpensive. The deliciousness of that meal: out of this world! \\n\\nThe pastries are the next big thing that I look forward too when coming here. It's by far the biggest bakery I've seen with the largest, freshest variety of pastries. \\n\\nThe produce, though I've never bought any myself (others with me have), is very well priced and VERY delicious. My only advice when coming here; know a little Spanish, it helps (I'm still learning). But don't worry, the staff is super friendly and fun (and patient). :)\",\n",
       " u\"This place was uber cool. I grew up 10 mins from the Mexican border so I was fortunate to grow up with authentic Mexican food- from restaurants and taco stands to my friends Nana making homemade tortillas and rice and beans and well, everything. \\n\\nWe were in the mood for carne asada tacos to grill at home and decided to buy some meat here instead of food city or the carneceria up the street. I heard about the hype and great reviews but never got around to checking it out. \\n\\nThis place rocks! 100% authentic and has everything I need to make virtually any Mexican dish I can remember. \\n\\nThe place is so cool. I can't get over it. Bakery, deli, tortilla factory, cheeses, meats, seafood, veggies, spices and candy. It has it all. It's pretty much the Mexican version of Lee Lee's, only cooler looking and more fun. \\n\\nCheck it out.\",\n",
       " u'Stumbled across this place early on a Saturday morning. Had a great breakfast burrito and horchata at the tortilliaeria and only wish I had hours to walk the rows of great produce. \\n\\nDefinitely going back!',\n",
       " u'I am from San Diego and have spent my fair share of time eating my way down the Baja peninsula. Having said that, this is the best Mariscos I have had since moving to Arizona. Very authentic. How can you beat awesome Mexican paella for 14 bucks? The bacon wrapped shrimp were to die for. Large, plump, juicy shrimp wrapped with crispy bacon. Six of them plus rice and beans for 13 dollars is a very good deal.\\n\\nThe service was great. Three of us ate till we burst for about 50 bucks. I would give five stars but the location is remote and near the airport so not a great area. Still, we will definitely be back.',\n",
       " u'The pupusas, yes, the pupusas are great. The loroco with cheese has become our favorite, But this past week, I strayed from our standard and tried the gallina soup with braised chicken and salad. All I can say is, \"What the hell? Where has this been my whole life?\" The soup is magical. Huge chunks of carrot, potato, and zucchini, with some thin noodles, and a savory broth with some mint leaves. I quickly abandoned the rest of my entree in favor of finishing the huge bowl of magic. It was the best soup I\\'ve had since coming to Phoenix 13 years ago. \\n\\nGood thing Hubby got sick this weekend- it gave me an excuse to go back and get some more. Being magical, you know it has serious healing properties. Here\\'s where I learned that the Sopa de Gallina is chicken soup without the chicken meat and the Sopa de Pollo is the same thing but with the meat. Two huge Styrofoam cups to go with lemon wedges and 4 hot and fresh tortillas cost less than $6.00. I was stunned. The owner said it costs more with meat. Believe me, you won\\'t miss it. Who knew that magic was so cheap? Hubby\\'s fever is already down and he\\'s feeling much better.',\n",
       " u'Been there twice now.  Great servers and the owner is a sweetheart.  I ate the Pechuga Asada and a pupusa Locoye(sp?) this time.  The chicken was made right, great beans and rice, fresh avocado,  big portions and the salsa and chips are excellent.   I live two blocks from here and I need to wake the eff up and go here more.',\n",
       " u\"This place is defintiely a hole in the wall, but aren't all the best finds that way? Their horchata was delicious. Creamy and authentic, without being to cinnamon-y. I was also a HUGE fan of their papussas and empanadas. Amazing!. I did not like their take on chile relleno though. It was a stuffed piece of the palm flower they use and it tasted acrid. Maybe it's a flavor that grows on you. Also wasn't too impressed by how clean the place felt, but the old pictures of the Valley in the 30s were pretty cool.\\n\\nOverall, good food and totally reasonably priced, but i would've loved to have a beer with my dinner. Only juices and sodas at this place.\",\n",
       " u\"Our son in law brought over a great sampling of foods from Guanaquito for us to try, and I have to say it was especially good. As a gourmet cook collecting recipes for 45 years, I appreciate the homemade quality and attention to preparation and ingredients. I don't mean to seem arrogant, but it's been a rare expereince for me to enjoy that sense of satisfaction from foods prepared by others in Phoenix. This has got to be one of our best local restaurants.\",\n",
       " u\"The pseudo-hubster LOVES this place and drags me along every once and again. The salsas, I think, suck, so that's a big time star auto-deduct. It's pretty dumpy inside and out, and it's almost always dead... this is pretty much the entire reason I like it. We can come here without seeing a soul we know, enjoy some good, traditional Mexican food, and enjoy a cerveza in peace.\",\n",
       " u'I took a friend and tried this place after reading the reviews here on Yelp. The food here is great!   Started with great chips and salsa, the green tomatillo salsa was especially good. Tried the shrimp tacos and the tacos durados chicken. Both were excellent, They were served with beans, rice, and a small salad. There was plenty of food for both of use, my friend gave me one of her tacos as she could not finish her plate. They have various Mexican beers and Bud Light available and it was served very cold with a frosty glass and a lemon slice. They also have Mexican bottled sodas in real glass bottles. We left stuffed and very happy.  I will definitly be back!!',\n",
       " u'Power yoga class today. \\nWhat great way to detox your body and find all the muscles and balance points you rarely use (you\\'ll find them the hard way, BTW, but that\\'s another story).\\nAs I was lying on the mat at the end of the class, listening to Max (our instructor/Chief Yogi), telling us to just be and to try to not think...try not to eat or drink for an hour after the session and just let our bodies detox, all I could think of was \"what can I eat to retox as quickly as possible, that won\\'t kill me where I stand?\"\\nNot an easy question to ponder, even with the existential power of yoga still pulsating through every fiber of my being...a chili dog from Ted\\'s or Long Wong\\'s?; an Italian Beef  from Luke\\'s; Chicken and waffles from Lolo\\'s?\\nAnd then it hit me, almost causing me to stir from my yoga induced coma, Taco\\'s de Juarez!!!!!\\nAs anyone who has read even one of my reviews will tell you, I am a \"Trendinista\" of the first order. \\nI follow the herd, make no mistake about it! \\nWhy?\\nBecause, occasionally, the herd knows where it\\'s going...and this is one of those very special occasions!\\nI had spotted this place before...on my way by at high speed, to get to Welcome Diner for a burger.\\nBut since I wasn\\'t packing, I never, ever stopped rolling, let alone got out of my car here. \\nYelp changed all that. This place has some terrific reviews, in spite of the fact that there isn\\'t a Betos or Bertos in sight. \\nWorth a try, right?\\nTaco\\'s of Juarez is a delightfully dirty little gem...the proverbial diamond in a goat\\'s ass. \\nI sat down and the sweet little non-english speaking waitress brought chips and salsa...The Two Grinders (Los Dos Molino\\'s) need to take salsa lessons from these folks...some of the best salsa I have had (the salsa verde is definitely the best I\\'ve had in the US...makes me long for couple of places along the beach in Bahia de Navidad).\\nIn an effort to retox as quickly as possible, I ordered the number 16 lunch especial...a shredded beef gordita (\"gordita\" means \"meat wrapped in lard, then deep-fried\" in Spanish) and a cerveza (ice, ice cold BTW).\\nFreakishly good...I know, it was almost pure lard that had been heated to point where it lost its molecular cohesion and liquefied...but it was damn tasty lard. I forked a little salsa chile and salsa verde onto the gordita (accompanied by refritos and rico) and dug in.\\nI awoke to shouts of \"clear\" as the feverish paramedics worked to restart my heart...just kidding! \\nI am fine:) !!\\nSo, go to the pawn shop and find yourself a nice little Sig Sauer 9mm pistol and holster, turn on the car alarm and go try Taco\\'s of Juarez. Possibly the best Mexican food in town!\\nAnd now, another one on my list of favorite places to retox after I\\'ve detoxed!',\n",
       " u\"First off I have to say thanks to the fellow yelpers!!! \\n\\nI have worked downtown for over 5 years and drove by this place every day twice a day.... and had no idea it was even open for business. The place looks abandoned and quite scary.  I have seen some interesting people next door and I would have never given the place a shot if it wasn't for you all!    On to the food :) \\n\\nSince this was my first time I thought I would try the basic Mexican food combo to judge the place.  I had the #17 Taco and Enchilada rice and beans I added beef to the enchilada. (comes shredded unless you specify ground) I can't say one bad thing about the dish. It was amazing. The rice was perfect for my taste and even the beans were good.  I really enjoyed the salsa. Some may not since it is not a fresh tomato and onion type of salsa. It is more like a hot sauce. The service was good. The atmosphere was good.  Prices are good. \\n\\nThis will absolutely be added to the Mexican Food Lunch rotation!!\",\n",
       " u'I drove by this place almost daily for years and never had the desire to go in. It looks downright scary from the outside and is wedged between a laundromat and a mexico bus station. The dirt parking lot doesn\\'t help the image either, nor does the fact that it looks like an abandoned titty club where you might find a dead stripper behind. \\n\\nNevermind all that.\\n\\nThis place has very good food. This place has very good prices. Damnit, this place has the hottest green salsa ever made. They don\\'t speak much English, but I can order food in Spanish so that works out. The green chiles actually appear to be fresh instead of that canned crap. Nothing on the menu was groundbreaking, but everything tasted fresh, clean, and well prepared. \\n\\nIf you go there, look at the sign on the window about the restroom being for customers only. I wrote it, swear. It had the word \"costumers\" and I asked them if I could escribe them a nuevo signo. They let me. I\\'ve got a little fame here.',\n",
       " u\"I actually liked the food here. The beef was flavorful and not dry at all and the chicken was good as well. \\nThe waitress gave us some chips and salsa but I was surprised that they didn't bring over any Pico.  Ah well....\\nThe horchata was pretty good so I would recommend that too.\\n\\nThe decor is pretty interesting. They have these super heavy chairs that are very uncomfortable so be prepared!\\n\\nI would have stayed longer and maybe ordered more food but there was a baby crying his little head off the whole time I was there and I had to get out of there.\\n\\nNext time I'll try some take out since I really enjoyed the food.\",\n",
       " u\"Disclaimer:  The following review is based on one visit.\\n\\nThis joint serves simple and solid fare.  With that said, it's not something I'd go out of my way for.  The enchilada-style carne asada burrito was fresh and authentic, however the beef lacked flavor and was cooked a bit tough.  The horchata is some of the best I've had in Phoenix.  I'll have to go back and try the sit-down experience for a more complete review.\",\n",
       " u\"I am 40 years old and have lived in Phoenix my whole life.  I have a passion for discovering new and unique restaurants around the valley.  As a child, I was raised on Jordan's Mexican food every Sunday after church.  I'm an atheist now, but I still frequent Jordan's for their hot sauce, tacos and delicious burritos, chimichangas and cheese crisps.  \\nI went to Tacos De Juarez for the first time a week ago after a D-backs game.  I ate a pizza at the game, but had to try the food at this place because it looked like a diamond in the rough.  After eating there, I have discovered; it is a diamond.  The food is absolutely amazing! The tacos have shells that are prepared in house, and the salsas are amazing.  I have been there one time since, and am planning on going tomorrow.  I cannot wait to try their selection of mariscos.\",\n",
       " u\"Yummy! I met some friends here for lunch a couple of weeks ago.  Do not be fooled by the exterior appearance.  I would not have visited if my friend hadn't already vouched for the place.  This is a hidden gem in Downtown Phoenix!  \\n\\nI ordered the cheese enchiladas and they were very tasty.  Most places overdo it with the onions but this place did not.  The chips and salsa were very good.  The red salsa was very hot in my opinion so be warned.  \\n\\nThe service was a little slow but the restaurant was very busy with a large lunch crowd so maybe that had something to do with it.  The food more than makes up for it.\",\n",
       " u'i love their $6.99 pie sale and love that they are introducing new healthy salad options.\\n\\ntheir prime rib is not bad!',\n",
       " u'Not bad. I had a good classic breakfast, but was a little put off that you can\\'t order \"sides\" of something. They call it \"a la carte\" but it ends up being almost as expensive as getting the entire meal! For instance, I got eggs, bacon, toast. I wanted to try some latkes, but did not want to order an entire latkes meal which came with toast and eggs. I asked for just a side of latkes...we don\\'t do a side, it is a la carte. Ok fine. $7.99!!!! The latkes MEAL was $8.99! Had a really poor server. I think this was his first job. Got a slice of pumpkin pie to go...pretty good. Nothing that I can\\'t get at Costco.',\n",
       " u\"Agree with all the great reviews, had to throw in my 4 stars and word of warning -\\n\\nI came here for lunch and ordered the half sandwich/cup o soup combo.  The chicken soup was bland and had a lot of corn in it which I've never seen before.  The roasted veggie sandwich was a lot of bread and not a lot of roasted veggies (should have read Sarah's review. . .doh!)\\n\\nBut everything else that everyone in the place was having looked amazing - burger, chicken caesar sandwich, chicken soft tacos, salads. . .my lunch mates were more than happy with their orders.  I happened to pick the two underwhelming items.  Poop.\",\n",
       " u\"The food was decent (not outstanding) and the atmosphere was excellent as this is such a nice restaurant setting. We enjoyed really friendly service and great cocktails at the bar but that service didn't move  with us to our table. Our server was off-hand and seemed permanently distracted (the place was not that busy) and made me repeat just about every word I said to him. OK so I'm British (lived in the US for 10 years) and so I try to speak slowly but this guy was just priceless, funny the first time he doesn't hear me, excusable the second time but by the third and fourth time, well I was done with him by then.\\nThis would have been a 4 star review but the seriously unimpressive table service puts me off coming back.\",\n",
       " u'Cozy. Charming. Comfortable. The three words that spring to mind when I think of our experience at Coronado Cafe last night.\\n\\nWe were a party of four, which is probably close to the largest party I would like to have there due to the intimacy of the space. \\n\\nThe converted house is quaint and elegant, but doesn\\'t feel pretentious or fancy. The food was excellent, and the service was (mostly) good. The only dock comes from having to repeatedly ask to fill our tiny water glasses. \\n\\nI had the vegetable rellenos with added flank steak, and my first thought when I took a bite was \"Oooh, I\\'m already looking forward to leftovers tomorrow for lunch!\" and then I proceeded to eat the entire thing. Darn.\\n\\nI can\\'t speak for my fellow diners, but everyone else\\'s meals looked fabulous.\\n\\nI had creme brulee for dessert, which was not the best I\\'ve ever had. The other desserts on the table, brownie sundae and caribbean bread pudding, looked divine.\\n\\nThis is a gem among the gems of 7th street, and I will definitely go again.',\n",
       " u\"Perfect Day, Perfect Brunch, Perfect Place. \\nYes that would be at the Coronado Cafe. \\n\\nStopped by on a Saturday afternoon and was pleased to see that they offered brunch as well as lunch. \\n\\nEvery thing sounded so goo it was hard to decide but I ended up getting a brunch item, the Crabby Benedict (see pics) which was two poached eggs over toasted focaccia, topped with blue crab, avocado, & hollandaise, served with caf\\xe9 potatoes & fresh fruit. \\n\\nOur food arrived fresh and on HOT Plates, I Seriously LOVED every bite and my daughter had The Biscuits and Gravy (see pics) and she cleaned her plate as well. \\n\\nWe sat outside and really enjoyed the patio, I'll have to go back to check out the inside on another Perfect Day!\",\n",
       " u\"This place was cute and clean and had nice personality, but when it came to the food it was very ordinary. These are dishes you can throw together yourself if you wanted. Nothing spectacular at all, I wouldn't come back to this place.\",\n",
       " u'My boyfriend and I went there last night, and I\\'ve been there for brunch before as well. It\\'s down the street from my house, so I WANT it to be good because it\\'s so cute and cozy, but I\\'ve never had anything I\\'ve actually liked there.\\n\\nI got the burger, which was decent, but it had this kind of garlic cheese spread on it, and when you\\'re eating it on porous ciabatta bread, it has a tendency to leak out the holes in the bread all over your hands. My boyfriend got one of the pizzas, which was burnt on the edges like it had been cooked too long. We also weren\\'t filled with confidence when 100% of the time we\\'ve passed by, the cook has been outside on his phone smoking a cigarette. Maybe my boyfriend\\'s food was overcooked because he had to take a very important call.\\n\\nWhen I went for brunch, I had the crab eggs benedict, and it was pretty flavorless. For what I\\'m paying there, I\\'d like to actually enjoy my food, but I was so underwhelmed, and since it\\'s always been dead in there and it\\'s got wood floors, everything you say echoes, which can be awkward.\\n\\nOne more thing: when you look at the menu online, the \"lunch and dinner menu\" is the lunch menu. The entrees and the prices change when you actually eat dinner there. I would have saved money and been better fed by going next door to America\\'s Taco Shop.',\n",
       " u'My fiance and I went here around lunch time on a Saturday afternoon. We were the only patrons in the restaurant.  I had a 3 dollar mimosa, and Nick had a mixed drink on the menu with gin.  The drinks were really good.... I only wish the service had been the same because I never was asked if I wanted a second, and I was never asked if I wanted any water.  When the food arrived it was delicous.  My sandwich was tasty and the salad with goat cheese was AMAZING!  I will be going back to have the full salad. Next time we go we will go during a busier time of day, maybe the server will be on his toes, instead of gabbing to the bar tender.',\n",
       " u\"I've been here twice with my girlfriends and every time I've ordered the same thing...b/c it's delicious!  The crab dip is cheesy and delicious on top of their citrus tortilla chips and the Farm Salad is worth every penny (especially with the chicken).  \\n\\nI am excited to bring the rest of my family to this cute little place...my favorite little place...on the corner!\",\n",
       " u\"I'm torn between 3.5 and 4 stores, but figured I'd bump it up a bit since service was so great. I came here for a lunch date with a friend and was pleased at the adorable cottage with ample outdoor seating. All the staff was very friendly and eager to please. We ordered the goat cheese bruschetta, the crab cake open sandwich and the chicken pesto sandwich.\\n\\nI certainly enjoyed everything we tried but there weren't any flavors that blew me away. The goat cheese bruschetta was certainly delicious but maybe I'm spoiled with bruschetta after a few trips to Postino. I loved the outdoor patio, perfect for a warm, sunny day.\\n\\nAll in all, I enjoyed my time at Cordonado Cafe but felt I was paying a little too much for the food I was getting. I'd love to go back during the night time to get a romantic table and bottle of wine outside.\",\n",

My wife had the roasted chicken sandwich and Gorgonzola salad, I had a bite and it was delicious.

       " u'i really really really like the personality of this \"newly\" discovered place. the evening temps allowed us to sit and enjoy on the patio. \\n\\nthe owner? greeted us and had a conversation with our dinner companions since they both lived/worked in Maryland at one point, demonstrating to me at least, that he seemed sincerely interested in his clientele.\\n\\nwe shared a crab dip app and i thought it was rich, creamy and delicious. but the problem with sharing an app with some folks is no one likes to take the last few bites, so i wound eating alot of it. i ordered the green chile sauce pasta, however, i was a little disappointed that there was not much green chile flavor/kick to the dish (i\\'m aware that not all green chile\\'s are fiery hot). my wife\\'s dish, the baramundi special, was much better, albeit a tad heavy on the rice. i also ordered a cup of clam chowder, but had it sent back because it had bacon in it. i don\\'t think clam chowder has bacon in it.\\n\\nwe were comp\\'d a mixed berry \"cobbler\" desert since a side salad that was ordered was not brought out. it was a huge desert, but rather cakey, and more like a berry shortcake than a cobbler. \\n\\noverall, a nice little place with a great atmosphere. excellent service and staff. many seafood options for non-meat eaters.',\n",

That's it. \\n\\nMy raves: Cutest house turned classy restaurant ever. I've been discovering more & more places like this and CC is by far my favorite. It still feels like walking into mamas kitchen except you get first class service & it's not free ;)\\nLook out for Triple J! Jillian, Janel, & JR always take great care of me!! They all have great attitudes, very personable, and know the menu very well. \\nYou can't go wrong with the crab cakes!! Or the miso salmon, mmmm!! Any seafood really. I've complained about my salmon not being cooked properly at other restaurants but that is not an issue here!!\\nI also love the Gorgonzola salad, chicken Caesar wrap, and meatloaf!!!\\n\\nAs others have mentioned, it's a great date place whether your date is a spouse, friend, or family member. I noticed a lot of people come in before a play- perfect ambiance for a romantic evening.\\n\\nGet a sitter for the kids- I would give you a Samantha Jones style stare down if you brought in loud grubby children who would definitely ruin my dinner in a cozy place like this. ( I am a nanny who loves children as well as dining out with children. But I also believe in adults having their happy place considering I don't go to the playground with cigarettes & beer to be in the way of 12 & under spring break! Thanks.)\\n\\nParking lot works, location is great- super close to I-10, but far enough away to not have the noise while on the patio.

Great egg salad sandwiches, blt\\'s, cheeseburgers that are\" real\" - interesting soups and specials. Potato salad is yumolicious.

       " u\"This place is fun to walk into, as it really looks like you're walking into a Depression era drugstore, not the 50's. It's crammed with old pharmacy stuff and signs, just lots to look at.\\nI really wanted to love this place but I can't because the service just isn't what it should be. We were helped by two of the staff during our visit, one very friendly waitress who breezed by and said hello  and a waiter who couldn't have appeared more miserable.  \\nI was surprised at how small and, hate to say it, dull, the menu is. Burgers, hot dogs and cold sandwiches. The burgers are from frozen patties and I actually had to pull a big chunk of cartilage out of my mouth. Yuck.\\nThey use Thrifty brand ice cream and have an extensive menu of ice cream sodas made with unusual flavors. We ordered our sundaes and for some reason, they were made one at a time, so that my companion was halfway through with his before mine was delivered, and it was completely wrong. Wrong ice cream, wrong topping. But it took so long to get that I just ate it. I'm not going to complain too bitterly over ice cream. And I hope this place works out its kinks and does well.\",\n",
       " u\"Checked this out for the first time with my boyfriend on Father's day. Waitresses were super cute and friendly. Ordered an Ice Cream Soda with Butterscotch soda and pecan praline icecream. It was sooo good! Had the reuben sandwich was also really good. Not a fan of their potato salad or cole slaw, kind of bland. This place is a real treat and loved the decor.\",\n",
       " u\"NOTE: Only reviewed the soda fountain, not the food (but I wouldn't come here for the food anyways!)\\n\\nI'm sad to say I found this place too late during my time in AZ. I LOVE this place! The soda combinations are amazing. I've tried the phosphates, egg-creams, malts, etc. My favorite soda/ice cream combos were the casablanca and the scarlett o'hara, but its mostly because they reminded me of sherbet ... yum :)\\n\\nI've heard the food is horrible so I wouldn't touch it considering the many other great eateries in the area. The only flaw I have found with this place is the hours of operation...they close really early which is horrible when the late night sweet tooth hit.  Great place to go on a hot day or on the weekends...especially if you like soda.\",\n",
       " u\"I love this place! (for the dessert, not the food; didn't try the food based on reviews) I'll be honest --we came because we saw they had a Butterbeer icecream float and we are huge Harry Potter nerds. But we ended up liking other stuff on the menu too. Where else can you get a huge icecream float with whipped cream and a cherry on top for $3.75? My friends and I each ordered a different float from their specialty menu (we were not adventurous enough to make up our own combo) and we each loved what we ordered. I would've drank all of mine if it hadn't been so huge. \\n\\nI also love the strange kitschy inside that's kind of dusty and vintage and odd. The sad part was the jukebox at our table was broken. Next time I'll play a song for sure!\\n\\nOnly gripe is that it closes at 8. Don't they know most people want dessert between the hours of 8-10 pm??\",\n",
       " u'My BFF has been trying to get me to go here for about a year now.\\n\\nThis place is a bit overwhelming. Part soda shoppe, part thrift store, part mini diner.\\n\\nThe thrift store portions have some great stuff. A great vintage fashion section, LOTS of records (your parents remember those, kids), and some great jewelry.\\n\\nThe mini diner area has, what I believe is all the original booths and counter. The booths are kind of small, and though they all have jukeboxes on them, they all seemed to be out of order while we were here.\\n\\nThey serve very simple diner food (hot dogs, hamburgers, fries, grilled cheese, etc), but their real specialty is their sodas and ice cream floats. There is a pretty large selection of sodas to choose from. We all went for the \"suggested\" combinations. I cant remember what mine was called, but it was red white and blue. Strawberry and vanilla ice cream in blueberry soda. So good. Warning: within 3 seconds of my 1st sip my entire mouth was blue. And it only got blue-er (and spread to my lips) with every sip. \\n\\nId gladly brave the blue lips again for that delicious little step back in time.',\n",
       " u\"This place is cute and quaint. And then you see the thrift shop next door, and it's even more cute and quaint! I really enjoyed the chicken sandwich. I ordered an ice cream soda, the one with mango, but it wasn't anything to write home about (if I wrote home, to begin with).\",\n",
       " u\"There's a place in Yuma, AZ called Chili Pepper which has some of the best Mexican fast food I've ever eaten. Once I moved to Phoenix, there has been a great citywide search by a group of us Yumans to find someone here that reminds us of Chili Pepper's marquee entree: The Bean, Rice & Cheese Burrito (not tm). Carolina's came close. Juan's fell decidedly short. A few other run down shacks that we've tried have always been inconsistant or disappointing...\\n\\nOne slow mid-morning at work we were trying to figure out a good fast place to get takeout and bring back to the office. Someone mentioned Ritos. Someone mentioned that they have the best bean and cheese burrito. My ears perked up. Upon arriving I noticed that they actually have a bean, rice and cheese burrito on the menu, something that most places have never heard of.\\n\\nThe burrito itself was HUGE. The salsa can be purchased in a large enough container that the whole burrito can be dipped in (don't laugh, this is an important aspect) and provides enough flavor and kick to compliment the beany goodness inside. After going there 3 times in one week, I am ready to declare this place even BETTER than my once perfect Chili Pepper.\",\n",

Now I'm craving it...haha oh one more thing its only open for lunch.\",\n",
       " u\"Oh man! I normally love mission style burritos with a ton of different things in them but this place makes me love one ingredient burritos. You cannot lose with their green chili burrito. I prefer getting the burrito enchilada style because the sauce is absolutely perfect and it is covered with cheese.

       " u\"I am from the San Francisco Bay area, on business in Phoenix. Let me keep it simpler and straight to the point; Rito's makes the best wet burrito  that I have ever had, the tender seasoned beef, and rich smoky enchilada sauce is absolutley incomprable. You must be able to 'move,' in a real neighborhood so if you are the 'coorprate,' type, keep your sorry behind in the hotel!

It\\'s every bit as good and may be more convenient for you.  It\\'s at 51st Ave. and Orangewood - Rito\\'s Burritos in the little strip mall.  Naturally I tested the green chile burro enchilada style and it was exactly the same, right down to the oversized pie plate.  Ahhh...\\n\\nDon\\'t worry, for those that are concerned Rito\\'s is going corporate, the new place still has those stylish iron bars between you and the kitchen, and although it has bathrooms, they are perpetually \"under repair,\" according to the glossy, pre-printed sign they\\'ve mounted on the wall.  And of course it\\'s still cash-only.  So they have preserved that special charm. \\n\\nI know this will make the line longer at the new place, but it would be unfair not to share the good news, especially when I learned about the original from here.  Enjoy!',\n",
       " u\"My mouth is salivating just from writing this review. I recently moved out of state and out of everything, friends included, Rito's Burritos are what I miss most.

Occasionally they will have a daily special, but most days it\\'s just the 6 to 8 things they have to chose from on their little menu board. They don\\'t advertise it, but they will make cheese crisps for your little ones. My daughter still hasn\\'t gotten into eating beans or spicy chicken or beef, and a couple of times they made her a quesadilla.\\n\\nDon\\'t be put off by the super huge line of people coming out the door, you will want to wait for this food. Make sure you have the time to find parking and wait. The reward is worth it.\\nIt\\'s cash only and they close a little after lunch time.

       " u\"Can you say burrito? Can you say waiting in line to taste the green chili yumminess is TOTALLY worth it? YES!! It's a hole in the wall in the middle of a neighborhood, but don't let the appearance distract you from the finished product! It's fabulous!!\",\n",

       " u\"So since I work downtown every once in a while,  when one of my co-workers feels up to it, he will make a Ritos run. Although I have never been to the physical location, I have to say that Ritos is hands down my favorite Mexican food place. I always order the green Chile burrito enchilada style with a side of rice and die and go to Heaven every time! I have also had their beef tacos with guacamole and the meat is so tender and juicy, it's truly amazing. I just wish they were open for a dinner run or on weekends so I could take my hubby.\",\n",
       " u\"Waaaaay overhyped!!! It's slow, pricey, and the food is just average. There is also zero ambience, but I knew that from the reviews so I didn't care. A lot of these things can be overlooked if the food was the bomb, but it wasn't anything special. Part of it has to do w/ the crappy and confusing menu, so I didn't get what I wanted.\\n\\nThe menu is confusing and the cashier didn't really explain things well either. My food took 30 minutes to get and that was after waiting in line for 10-15 minutes in their non-air-conditioned building. The food was good but average and quite a lot of excess tortilla compared to the amount of filling, and the sauce was quite salty. What was $11 here would be $8 everywhere else so I don't know how they get away with charging so much given their location and building.\",\n",
       " u\"Pretty impressed.  Great value for the price you pay.  Not everything I had was a home run, but a truly legit Mexican take out spot.\\n\\nI had recently seen the Check Please AZ segment and read the Yelp reviews about this place.  I live downtown but up until now I didn't even know this place existed.  So I decided to stop by at opening on Saturday morning.  The location is exactly what I expected.  A divvy hole in the wall in the middle of residential street in the Garfield District.  The only parking is in the street and the building isn't labeled so be sure to know the address of this place in advance.  I had heard this place was typically busy at lunch during the work week but expected to get in and out pretty fast on a Saturday.  Uh, no.  The line was 12 deep when I arrived which was just 5 minutes after 10am.  The crowd in line was super diverse (white, black, hispanic, and even asian folks) so clearly word has gotten out about this place.  I believe you can call in your order if you wanna run by and pick it up rather than wait in line like I did.\\n\\nSo after about 10 minutes in line, I got to put in my order.  The dish that seemingly everyone talks about as Rito's 101 is the Green Chile Burrito Enchilada Style with Red or Green Sauce (I went with Red).  A family friend raved about their refried beans so I got some of those in the bowl as well.  Total price was $10 (FYI, they take credit and debit cards now so its no longer cash only).  Took about 20 minutes to get my food.  It's strictly a takeout place, but they do have a tiny amount of seating outside the building.  Being that it was a warm summer day when I went, I decided to just make the 5 minute drive home to eat.\\n\\nAlright to the food.  Portions are huge.  Burrito comes in a huge bowl and was oozing red sauce with beans on the side (see my photo).  Smelled divine.  I've had a lot of burritos in my time, but this is up there with some of the best I've had.  Great chunks of meat mixed in with Hatch green chiles.  The red sauce and cheese complimented the tortilla very well and the sauce wasn't as watery as I had feared.  Great burrito all around.  The beans on the other hand were a disappointment.  Maybe its just me, but I prefer my refried beans to have a little more chunkiness to them.  Rito's beans are almost more of a puree.  The taste is fine, I just prefer to taste like I'm biting into actual chunks of beans.\\n\\nAll in all, I was impressed at the size and quality of the food I got for the money.  As busy as it was today, I can't even imagine how busy it gets during the work week.  Next time I come here I'll try to call ahead and maybe give the chimichangas a whirl.  Would certainly recommend this spot if you're in the neighborhood.  And if you're still hungry after eating one of their burritos, its your fault.\",\n",

Scottsdale), San Carlos Bay (CenPho), or San Diego Bay (Guadeloupe).\\n\\nThe place has a bit of a rep for crab enchiladas (there was a blurb in Gourmet a few years ago), but they may be one of the more bland things on the menu. \\n\\nI'm going to second the idea that the shrimp dishes are a great way to fall for this place on the first visit. The camarones culichi are awesome, with a tomatillo sauce that should be distilled into bath salts. Snapper veracruz is delicious if you're looking to test one of the more typical preparations. \\n\\nOh -- This place isn't really that parking-sketchy (especially if you've experienced the Ranch Market demo derby up the street) and they have their own lot right in front.\",\n",
       " u\"This is the best Mexican seafood restaurant I've been to.  Yum, yum, yum.  I loved the chips and green salsa.  The draft beer comes in a huge margarita-like glass, enough for two people to share if you don't want too much to drink.    The Camarones Culichi was heavenly.  The service is friendly and prompt.  The atmosphere is warm and cozy, yet also festive.  The prices are extremely reasonable, especially given the quality of the food and the complimentary ceviche before the main entree.  Absolutely everything was delicious.  This place should be packed on a Saturday night, although it's okay with me if just a few people know about this culinary gem.  I want to try their tequila have my next birthday celebration here--drinks, awesome food, friendly staff--sounds like the perfect place for a party.\",\n",
       " u'Last summer my boyfrined and I started the Summer Ceviche Project, which was to visit all the Mexican seafood places that populate the southern part of the near-east side.  This was the first place we tried.  After 13 places, we stopped trying anything else.  This is literally the gold standard.\\n\\nNot to say there isn\\'t amazing ceviche in other places, or even great ceviches at trendier spots.  This is just what all ceviche needs to start its life as: shrimp, cucumbers, onions and tomato.  Slice of avacado on top, ample selection of hot sauces if you so desire.  (He does, I don\\'t.)    \\n\\nIf you want to add or create away from that basic recipe.  So be it.  It\\'s been done nicely at loads of expensive trendy spots. (Scottsdale: Seriously, $10 for a tostada?) But if you do it this good, why in the world would you mess with it?\\n\\nBack to MPH:  The tomatillo-avacado salsa is one of the biggest reasons I can never leave Phoenix.  I would literally crinkle up and die if I didn\\'t get it once a week.\\n\\nJust go.   It\\'s seafood, so the regular menu is not \"cheap mexican.\" \\nBUT, nine times out of ten, I just go in for a beer, a ceviche tostada.  If we go during happy hour, two beers, two ceviche tostadas and chips and salsa will set me and the boy back $12.  During scorching summers, who wants any more food than that?  When it\\'s 115 outside, getting a lovely, air conditioned place to sit, drink a beer, eat great food....and leave for under $20 for two people makes this a true find.\\n\\nLast note: the place is freaking ADORABLE, the service is amazing, and if you go more than twice, they will start to remember you.  Which is nice.',\n",
       " u'Great location, sea food is fresh, I enjoy the end of the week.  Garlic Shrimp dish blew me away.  One of those places when you finally eat there you were thinking why it took so long.  Real Food is here, Look for their three locations in the Valley',\n",
       " u\"Going to Mariscos Playa Hermosa is like taking a quick vacation to Rocky Point. The seafood was fresh, the service friendly and the atmosphere authentic. I went with the advice of a previous yelper and ordered the molcajete. And she was right, it truly was a volcano of food. Chicken, steak, fish and shrimp all surrounding a bubbling green sauce that's so good you want to drink it. Beans, rice, salads and fresh tortillas were served on the side, perfect for making your own little burritos. The complimentary ceviche tostadas were a nice touch and the green salsa was BUENO. The margaritas were really good too, although they were pretty small. All in all, it was well worth the drive and I can't wait to go back. \\n\\nNote to late diners: they close at 8:00 :(\",\n",
       " u\"If your love seafood and are craving mexican food, this place is it! Don't let the outside or surrounding buildings intimidate you. The food is well worth the trip!\\n\\nWith free chips and salsa and also a delicious free bit of their ceviche while you order and wait, ya really can't go wrong! Its a bit small inside but perfectly sized for a nice peaceful meal without the room full of loud customes that normally comes with a great restaurant. The staff is friendly, and the mood is colorfully relaxing. I live in E. Mesa and its even worth the drive! :-)\",\n",
       " u\"The exterior of the building might be unappealing but once you step in it's whimsical and cheerful. This is a Family Owned Sinaloan Style Seafood Restaurant that is open every day for lunch and dinner.\\n\\nRight away they gave us house made chips , the daily made green guacamole style salsa and the spicier red salsa. They are delicious and differ from other salsas I've tried elsewhere and I only tried a few and then they presented Mini Complementary Tostada Ceviches and gosh they were excellent and were better in taste (not quality of fish)  than some I've tried at high end dinning destinations paying maybe the same as my whole meal here and these were FREE here. \\n\\nI always enjoy the fish veracruzana with vegetables but this time tried the fish with poblano peppers , onions and tomatoes. Both these dishes I can tell you are as tasty as can be. The fish filet is mild and fresh with a feather light batter that is not oily being the lightest batter I have ever seen on a delicate fresh fish. For me what makes these dishes so great is the delicious well made light sauces they are in. Also included are very soft fresh tasting tortillas and on the platter was salad , refried beans and a white rice with mixed vegetables that is yummy from the sauce of your dish. All this food I got was only $13.00 It was not good but very good.\\n\\nWhile we were dining I noticed most people were ordering what looked like a steaming large cauldron of mixed grilled meats and fish , I found out this dish is called Malcajete and it looked great to try.\\n\\nThey offer many variations of fish , steamed , grilled , battered, and breaded with a variety of sauces. Very little in the way of chicken or beef but they do have some.\\n\\nIt's a small family run business so when they get busy sometimes they go down a bit I noticed on a visit after I wrote this Yelp.\\n\\n3.5-5 stars\",\n",
       " u\"I am kicking myself for not trying this place sooner. I found it thanks to a Yelp search. The moment I walked in I felt like I was in downtown Rocky Point. Everyone has pretty much covered the complimentary Chips & Salsa but they can't describe how delicious the Green one was. It was not like anything I have ever had. It has a taste of creamy avocados and was perfect with the Chips but also was perfect on the fried fish I had. I sliced some of the fish and put it in a freshly made flour tortilla and spooned some of the Green sauce on it and was in heaven. I ordered the fried (breaded) Fish & Shrimp. The shrimp needed no sauce at all. The breading was perfectly seasoned and the shrimp were some of the largest and tastiest I have had. There was way to much food for even a hearty eater. Don't let the location scare you it is perfectly safe and the place is warm and inviting inside. My only regret is I was to full to eat some of the yummy looking deserts in the case. I am going to make room for them next time if I have to split a plate with someone but in any case I will be back.\",\n",
       " u\"I've been here several times and just finally got the time to tell everyone about the delicious food this place has to offer. \\n\\nI have eaten a variety of their plates and everything has been amazing. Their cocktail shrimp is great. Shrimp and Pescado ceviche is clutch! I enjoyed every bite. Camarones a la crema de broccoli is amazing. I thought it sounded weird at first, but once I digged in I wanted more after each bite. I really want to try every plate!\\n\\nMy 5 year old nephew is a VERY picky eater. I don't think he's ever tried seafood and liked it, but I somehow got him (okay forced him) to have camarones a la plancha once. Whabam! He LOVED the camarones a la plancha. He refuses to eat any other shrimp if it isn't like how playa hermosa prepares them.\\n\\nWent during happy hour and got SUPER CHEAP Negra Modelo. They have soccer games playing, so enjoy a nice michelada or beer watching your favorite team. \\n\\nThe service is great too. The owners are super nice. They really care about their customers. \\n\\nThe place is in shady looking area, but don't let that frighten you. The place is a diamond in the rough.\",\n",
       " u'We really enjoy the seafood here.  Our favorites are fried fish with diabla sauce (really hot!) and fried fish with culichi sauce.  The ceviche tostada is great too!  Our sons like the fajitas.  I have recommended it to my sister and family when they travel to phoenix.  We have been coming here for years.',\n",
       " u'What a fantastic meal I had.  I\\'ve been desiring amazing Mexican restaurants in Arizona.  Since I moved here, I\\'ve been to several places that were underwhelming, at best, and generally just not good to me.  So, I\\'d given up on Mexican Food in AZ and I just didn\\'t eat any.  Well, a conversation in Yelp Talk about Mexican Food inspired me to check out some different places and this one turned up in my searches on Yelp and other websites.\\n\\nI\\'m happy to say that I was so thrilled and enjoyed my meal very much at Mariscos Playa Hermosa.  Again, another hole-in-the-wall, but still quite the find.  Mariscos is located in a pretty seedy part of town, so don\\'t get nervous going there.  They close early, so you\\'d better arrive early.  You will find that there is a full bar inside this colorfully decorated resto.  Don\\'t eat at the bar.  That things not suitable for anything except decoration as the bar itself doesn\\'t extend out far enough to make it comfortable to sit there.  (this is a tip from a person who opted to sit at the bar)\\n\\nI tasted a few items off the menu.  The shrimp in diablo sauce was my favorite.  I ordered extra diablo sauce on the side.   The sauce has a smokey taste with the heat of the peppers.  Perfect for my heat seeking taste buds.  They prepare the sauce \"fresh to order\".So there is a charge for $3 for the extra sauce on the side to go.  I used that sauce to make more shrimp diablo at home later that week.  \\n\\nI also enjoyed the camarones culichi... shrimp in green sauce.  Culichi is a tomatillio sauce made with some dairy product and cilantro and of course the poblano or tomatillio peppers.  The sauce is simply to die for.  I left there satisfied and happy!  \\n\\nI will return and take a friend for the Molcajete Caliente with verde sauce.  Can\\'t wait.  I\\'m sure it will please.\\n\\nThey have a check-in offer too, so be sure to check-in.\\n\\nOh, that parking lot is TINY.  Be aware of that when you go.',\n",
       " u\"This is my absolute favorite favorite place now!! Everything we've had has been great but our go to dish is the Molcajete Caliente and I will probably never steer away from it. The sauce? BOMB. The tortillas? BOMB. The octopus? BOMB.\",\n",
       " u\"I've tried every Marisco spot in phoenix and this place is on another level. Great staff , amazing food and good tres leches cake. Food always Is fresh and the appetizers are out of this world good. I ate here 2 times in one week when I first found out about it.\",\n",
       " u\"Our visit to Mariscos made us feel like we were on vacation in Mexico. The salsas (rojas and verde) and chips that we were greeted with were tasty, as was the ceviche. We started with the Mexican Shrimp Cocktail (we each had one), very nice with lots of shrimp and avocado. I had the green cheese enchiladas - LOTS of cheese and sour cream - yum! My husband had the octopus rancheros - he proclaimed it delicious. Both were served with rice, lettuce salad, and beans. The beans were much better than the usual.  We were too full for dessert, should have shared the shrimp cocktail.  House red wine was good and prices were reasonable. It's a long drive for us since we are near Pinnacle Peak, but we will be back.\",\n",
       " u'Raised in Arizona, I have spent the last 13 years in Michigan, where salsa often consists of ketchup with cut tomato in it. I craved fresh chips and salsa, and I am in heaven. I ordered the Cameron Ranchero, and it was excellent. A great place to get reacquainted with good Mexican food!',\n",
       " u'Went once with my GF and have been back 3 times since! I always get the whole fish plate its sooo good.  I really like the mincheladas also. mmmmm.',\n",
       " u'One of my favorite place when it comes to seafood. I have tried many things on the menu but I have to say my all time favorite are the fish tacos! I have tried the aguachile and it is good I personally would of liked it more spicy and some more avocado which traditionally comes with. The micheladas are     Pretty darn good. If your up for trying something outside the box try the camarones culichi.',\n",
       " u'I have never taken the time to write a review until now. I consider myself a strong critic of Mexican food, because I\\'m from California, and have eaten at many authentic \"hole in the walls\" This place is truly a hidden gem!  My family and I had several dishes including the whole red snapper, shrimp culuchi I and carne asada all where excellent.  This will surely be a stop of mine every time I visit Phoenix.',\n",
       " u\"OMGS you guys. This is a little diamond in the rough. Nice and cheap, with a modest, but DELICIOUS, menu. I share the combo platter with my BF and then usually get the chicken, which is so moist and tender and slathered in creme...\\n\\nAnd it comes with a little cup 'o chicken soup which is yum-sauce.\\n\\nPapusas.  Need I say more?\",\n",
       " u\"Really nice place to catch a reasonably priced dinner! From the outside it doesnt look all that special but dont let that fool you. Inside is clean and nicely decorated.

Wouldn't hesitate to come back again soon!\",\n",

       " u'Decided to stop by after a recommendation from a family member, and I was not disappointed. I had a pupusa filled with meat and cheese, and arroz a la Valeniana, which is a rice dish with chicken and shrimp mixed in. Both were delicious.

       " u\"Why aren't there Sonics in MA?? It's a great alternative to other fast food, even if it isn't all that much healthier.\\n\\nWe made a stop right before heading to the airport and my breakfast burrito of ham and cheese was simple, but great. And the strawberry smoothie I had along with it really hit the spot. \\n\\nThe popcorn chicken we saved to eat on the plane was ok, the Toaster chicken sandwich was better, but both probably should be eaten piping hot.\\n\\nAnd can I just say - what better idea than to order and have food brought to your car in the winter in New England? Brillant, I'm telling you I should open a franchise!\",\n",
       " u'During my time living in Maryland I\\'ve seen a good deal of Sonic commercials on the tele.  Being that I have never seen a Sonic, I was perplexed by these commercials.  So, using the power of the internets I discovered that there weren\\'t any Sonics in the state of Maryland.\\n\\nWhen I moved to my new home of San Diego, I was confronted by the Sonic commercials yet again.  I internet-searched again and found the nearest Sonic was about 2 hours away.  My perplexion flexed into downright dismay.  Commercials are expensive endeavors--so why would a company essentially throw their money away by advertising whereever they are not located?\\n\\nOne night, my friend Jen picked me up at the Phoenix Airport for a nice hangout weekend.  We were both really hungry and deciding where to nosh.  When out of the corner of my right eye i spy a garish forty-one hundred kelvin fluorescent beacon in the night.  I thought it was some sort of carwash or super-sized gasstation at first glance.  Jen explained that was a Sonic.  \"What the fvck\\'s a Sonic?\" I replied.  To this point I have never seen a Soinic before in the flesh or in the disgusting eyesore of a prefab materials and light, as it were.  So it was decided right then and there that we would eat this Sonic.\\n\\nNow, I know I cannot speak for all the distant Sonics in parts of the world a young hooligan such as myself has never been to, but to this, my virgin Sonicage, I can.\\n\\nThere is a huge slab of concrete which seemed way too large for the size of the building.  On this slab was lots of parking spots under a handfull of overhangs shining enough fluorescent light to make a operating room mildly jealous. Beside each of the parking spots was a lit-up menu with fast-food type stuffs, drinks, slushies, smoothies, ice cream sundaes, banana splits, etc.  As if this wasn\\'t enough, they also have a drive-thru.  Again my perplexion returned.\\n\\nThe awful shine of it all, the harshness on weary eyes... It is a monument to decadence to the point of bloatation and bloatiosity.\\n\\nWhile we were deciding what we wanted a Mexican family rolled up beside us with a roller-skated jalopy and young children in the back.  They ordered and pulled away blasting some thuggish gangsta rap as their trunk buzzed with whorish flapping sheetmetal not sealed or sealed or sealed.\\n\\nJen ordered blackberry iced tea and some fried mac n\\' cheese bites, I, the tater-tots with cheese and a cranberry limeade. We pulled away blasting while our thuggish gangsta rap as our trunk rattled and flapped whoreishly--waves dissipating into the must of chaparral, waves lifting into the witheringchaped desert night.\\n\\nGot home and ate in normal lighting--Lighting that didn\\'t make one\\'s flesh crawl rutty-riddled with hungover insomniacian interrogation prior to a privilege afforded to be actually hungover.\\n\\nThe drinks were surprisingly not overly sweet and made with lots of that pellet style-ice that we so heart in drinks like these.  The iced tea was quality and the crisp tartness of my cranberry limeade (with actual half of a real lime floating in it) was perfectly refreshing.  The mac n\\' cheese thingees tasted like a crispy fried stouffers mac n\\' cheese.  Sadly, these are a limited time only option. As for my tater-tots with cheese, eh, not so good.  They were just bland cafeteria-style tots with a slice of American cheese thrown ontop--A wrinkly transparent orangish shellac coalescing my tots into a gelatinous choir.\\n\\n...and that was and is how I met a Sonic.',\n",
       " u'Two of my colleagues and I had a business lunch at Sonic and tour outing was very fun.\\nI was a novice to the Sonic experience as I took everything in.\\nThe parking lot was clean, we had a nice view of a Arizona State Tree - the Palo Verde and a clear perspective of a colorful storage facility.\\nWe ordered our lunch through the Sonic Remote Audio device and paid remotely on the same apparatus, via credit card.\\nOur lunch was delivered to the car within minutes, by our cheerful car hop waiter. \\nI had a grilled chicken sandwich, tater tots(recommended by my friend) and a lemon/berry drink.

       " u\"Not normally a Sonic fan or fast food for that matter, but for some reason when new items come out at fast food joints, I feel compelled to try them. Remember the McDLT? \\nThe latest is the new Premium Chicken Sandwich (i tried the classic with mayo, lettuce, tomato) and used a 2-1 coupon which you can get by joining the email club. I thought these new sandwiches were pretty good, the chicken breast was thin and well cooked and seasoned and the bun was a giant Ciabatta one that held everything together well. It is pretty healthy, although you might want to get the mayo on the side to help that out because they put alot on there and its shredded lettuce, not leaf style, which is better on a sandwich in my opinion. It's under 5 bucks for one sandwich and is a decent option now if I'm in a pinch and need something tasty and healthy for lunch. \\nTheir commercials still stink, but food is improving.\",\n",
       " u\"Great food, and affordable as well.  My wife and I get it to go.  It travels very well.  I've had better Naan, but overall.  It's great Indian when you have the craving.  Tip:  Don't get the Meat Naan.\",\n",

       " u\"We've recently moved to Phoenix and we've been looking for a fantastic Indian restaurant (and I think we've found it!)\\n\\nThe restaurant is nice, with nice decor. The service was friendly and quick. The waiter was a pro and we loved one to ten spicy-scale for our dishes. I ordered Veggie Korma, he got the Chicken Tikka Masala,  and we shared some Naan and the 'assorted snacks' (Vegetable Pakora, Samosa, Sheesh Kabab, Papadum). Everything was DELICIOUS. Giant food baby. We'll be back for the lunch buffet and we can't wait.\",\n",
       " u'Let me just preface this review by saying that it does pain me to write a negative review about almost any establishment in the valley.  Unfortunately for India Delhi, it has to be done.  Honestly, I have not dined inside this restaurant, my experience is purely from multiple take out orders over the past year.\\n\\nLiving in Arcadia and loving food as I do, I am lucky in the fact that I do not have to travel far to enjoy ethnic culinary delights that other cultures have to offer.  If your a foodie in the 21st century, Indian food is all over your radar.  India Delhi, found at 54th street and McDowell in Phoenix, fits the bill of almost every other Indian restaurant in the valley. Nice external building, clean looking restaurant and the normal tinctures related to that region of the world.  \\n\\nAlways friendly and eager to take your order, the young gentleman at the front counter has never let me down in taking care of my to go order. Always checking each container to make sure it has the correct contents, etc.  On the Saturday I am referencing for this review, the young man was not there, but the owner and his wife were. In my opinion, Indian food is not a cheap venture. I always find myself wanting to try a dish as well as getting a staple that I know is going to be solid. When you add in the extra charge for rice(never included), yogurt sauce(not included), etc, the bill for myself and companion always tops $40.  I usually do not gripe as I know the quality will be there and I just love the food, what can I say.\\n\\nOn this Saturday though, something was different. This was evident from the moment I walked in the door, I could not put my finger on it, but something was just not vibing.  The owners wife(or co owner for all I know) was at the counter and asked if I wanted the buffet. I politely turned it down as I am not a fan of buffet food, especially with Indian cuisine.  I politely turned that down and proceeded to order tandoori chicken, saag paneer, chicken biryani, basmati rice and some naan.  \\n\\nWhat happened next is not something I will forget soon.  I watched as the owner walked out of the kitchen with the pan in hands and used the spinach for my saag paneer from the buffet.  The owners and my eyes met as he processed that I saw what he was doing.  In that moment, the owner sold and gave up all his culinary credibility. He proceeded to head back to the kitchen to use said items.  \\n\\nI waited for another fifteen minutes and took my order home.  What did I find? The chicken biryani, the only item I might add not in the buffet, was extremely hot, almost too hot to touch.  The saag paneer was warm at best. The tandoori chicken was a collection of small legs(customary for Indian buffets) and once again, not hot.  I knew what had happened and could not help feeling beyond annoyed with the situation.\\n \\nNormally, I just deal with what is, I do not ever send food back and especially on to-go orders.  This time was different, I could not let it go.  I called the restaurant and without pause the owner got on, knowing exactly who I was and what the problem was. He put up a fight for around 20 seconds saying that he just used the spinach as a base for the saag paneer and what not, but then finally just apologized and said he would \"make it right.\"  \\n\\nI do not really see myself going back here, but who knows.  This is a good excuse to venture out and try some more of the valleys offerings in this arena.',\n",
       " u\"Great, authentic, delicious Indian food.  We are always excited to make the trip over here, knowing we'll get some REAL Indian food.  The samosas, garlic naan, biryani, and lamb korma are among my favorites, and should always be had with a mango lassi.  Ah, perfection.  \\n\\nThe only thing that is making me hesitant to give that last star is their lunch buffet.  Not the biggest selection - which wasn't a huge deal... still plenty to eat. The problem was the temperature of everything.  I was seriously afraid that I was going to get food poisoning (I didn't, thank goodness).  This can not be a safe temp to keep food at for more than 10 minutes!  Although, the husband claims that it is pretty much the same at all Indian buffets... you can tell, I usually just order off the menu wherever I go.  \\n\\nDefinitely stick to the menu, and your experience will be 5-stars.  Attempt the buffet at your own risk...\",\n",
       " u\"Lunch at the Dal House\\n\\nFor the ignorant, like me, there's a small plate for one or all of the several salads, a large plate for the entrees, and small bowl for the desserts.  Those tiny salad plates get full of everything fast.\\n\\nMy favorite feature - the store in the east end of the building.  I want to go back and pick upf a little henna for my Friday night henna painting parties and some of the foods that made my mouth water, for instance, cilartro and ginger.  \\n\\nYou can have lunch however you like.  Spicy or not hot, meat or veggie.  Delhi Palace serves a good lunch buffet.  Speaking of service, I hate to whine and I realize it was a Lunch buffet, but I felt forgotten more than once.  It was one of three reasons.  My server was either a new hire or the bosses son, or human beings of the SIkh persuasion focus on service to humankind.  I got the bosses son.  My tough naan came in the middle of the meal while people around me were breaded while in the buffet line.  My ice tea was almost forgotten.\\n\\nThis place has beautiful decor.  A romantic place for a darkened corner meal for you and that special someone who loves Indian food.  You could curry up some real heat in this place.\",\n",
       " u'Excellent food, very authentic. We love the garlic naan and every main dish we have ever ordered have been flavorful and delicious.  We like the fact that each of us can order our own degree of spiciness.  The atmosphere is charming and the service has always been warm and friendly. We highly recommend the Indian Delhi Palace.',\n",

       " u'Awesome. Indian. Buffet.',\n",
       " u\"I like. I don't get over here that often, but when I do, I always have a good meal. With restaurants that vary their spice levels according to your taste, it's always nice when you find one where your medium hot corresponds to their medium hot and so on. Too many times I've ordered 4/5 for spicy and gotten a 2/5 of 6/5 (yes, that's a thing that can happen). Their naan is delicious, always served hot and fresh baked. The Madras Shrimp are great if you can take the heat, if not, the butter chicken is everything butter chicken should be. Mango kulfi for dessert! Or gulab jamun, as fun to say as it is to eat.\",\n",

I think there are only a few places in the valley for Indian food for me (but I haven't been to every one in the valley) -- this place, The Dhaba in Tempe on Apache, and one other that has a great buffet but I haven't been there in years because it's far away. Somewhere in Mesa perhaps?\",\n",
       " u\"Big bunch of family over so we created our own buffet!  Shrimp biryani, veggie biryani, tandoori shrimp and tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala, palak paneer, samosas, raita, and lots of naan (plain, cheese and garlic).  Everyone loved the chicken...which I don't eat, but others said it was good.  I loved both biryanis and the paneer with raita over it.  I also loved the naan dipped in masala sauce! SO glad it's close to home!\",\n",

It turned out great.\\n\\nBesides the 2 female bartenders (1 was quite pregnant but still busting her ass), a girl with her boy friend, her sister, & 2 gay guys I was the only other white person there.

Country is her sound. A lot of regulars I figured out after almost not going in...but once in... they all were friendly too me. Pool tables with tournaments on wed, sat, and Sunday, tables were in great shape, they said the owner was a state pool champ and loves his pool tables. Dart boards were not in use but looked new.

       " u\"After recently visiting La Grande Orange in Phoenix, La Bocca in Tempe, and The Parlor in Phoenix, I can honestly say I have had much better pizza than Red Devil. \\n\\nFour of us came here last week for a birthday dinner, and I honestly just wasn't impressed. We ordered the Italian Special and the Greekfest, and both were overloaded with toppings and falling apart, and overall not too flavorful. Olives were everywhere, and if you are only a partial olive fan, it isn't too great. \\n\\nPlus side- the service was very good and I had a cup of the soup that was decent.\\n\\noverall probably wouldn't come back.\",\n",
       " u\"Phoenix has some absolutely amazing Italian pizza joints. And when I'm in the mood to spend some extra money and wait a while I go to them.\\n\\nBut man alive! Red Devil is pretty close in terms of quality and it's a lot more laid back.\\n\\nDuring our last visit, we sat in back. The space has several nice little tucked away areas so everywhere has a nice private feel. Our waitress was really nice and accomodating and was with us in just over a minute.\\n\\nSome of the fancier drinks were recommended, but we were content with just plain old lemonade. Just the right balance of sweet and tangy.\\n\\nThe bruschetta arrived quickly fresh out of the oven. The oil and tomatoes were spilling over the top and had a very rich flavor.\\n\\nThe Italian pizza was just right temperature wise and the green olives added a nice salty kick to the sausage.\\n\\nThe prices are reasonable. The staff is great and the pizza is delicious. \\n\\nPlus we met a 6 year old in the parking lot who claimed to be a princess. How great is that?\",\n",
       " u'You can either dine in or wait outside and order at the order window that is situated outside. While you waiting you can either get a drink at the bar inside or take a short walk to the other bar connected to the restaurant in the back. The waiter service is always great every time I have come here and we always sit in the back in the larger part of the restaurant. It is kinda divey in here as there are no windows, it is just a brick built restaurant and the general atmosphere is dim. However this is good comfort food, the pizza is so good and they use quality ingredients for everything. They also make their own beer which was surprisingly pretty good.',\n",
       " u\"This place is a good fall back place for my husband and me when we really don't want to have to think about what to do for dinner. Whether it is pizza or pasta dishes, it's always good and satisfying. The wait time is usually too long even when you see a lot of empty tables, but that is my only complaint. The servers are always nice and pleasant. I've been at least a dozen times and have never had a bad experience.\",\n",
       " u\"I can remember riding along with my grandma to go order a pie from Red Devil's takeout window.  Seeing the guys hand-toss the pizza dough in the air was always mesmerizing to me as a kid.  \\n\\nTheir pizza crust has not changed, though I'm not sure they still hand-toss the dough anymore.  But its still nice and crispy with the prefect amount of chew.  The price is about par with Streets, etc.  \\n\\nOnly thing that sucks about Red Devil - The Parking Lot.\",\n",
       " u'We wanted some quick take out and decided to hit up Red Devil las night.  We got a sausage pizza togo.  Honestly it was just ok, I wouldnt say anything amazing, but not horrible either.  Pinos on central is our first choice and Red Devil wont win out over Pinos.',\n",
       " u\"Let me start off by saying that I've been going to this location for 30+ years. The only food I order here is the bruschetta,pizza and wings. They have a pizza and wings special for $26 and it's the BEST pizza in town. I've been to the other locations but for some reason the pizza and wings taste best here. I live in the far west valley and I make the trip all the way to east Phoenix to enjoy their pizza. If you're ever in the area I would recommend the pizza and wings special to anyone.\",\n",
       " u'I heard a lot about Pete\\'s Fish and Chips, so had to give it a try. I went after work, however noticed in the drive thru line that it said \"cash only\" and no $50 or $100 bills. Unfortunately, all I had was a card on me, so just went home instead. Determined to try it, I went the next day and tried the Seafood Combo Platter that included 2 fish, 7 shrimps, and fries. The menu was very large and had various items. It was delicious for fast food seafood! The shrimp was huge, fish was large square-shaped, and the portion size was very large! It could easily be shared among two people. I was also happy to see that they had Horchata. I will definitely be back!',\n",

       " u\"I don't really know why but i expected to not quite enjoy Honey Bear's BBQ. Most of that is because when i think of BBQ anything i don't think of buying it more someone outside cooking it for me. Yet when i went in I can say I enjoyed. I ate the shredded chicken sandwich and was super happy with it. Though not a go to place if i get the craving I will pop back in again.\",\n",
       " u\"This was a pretty decent place for good BBQ.  There isn't that much variety - mostly focused on BBQ meat sandwiches.  The good thing is that despite the small menu, what they do have is pretty good - I had the BBQ beef, which was tasty and had a ton of flavor.\",\n",
       " u\"Okay, totally ecstatic about the Big Red! And the pulled pork, was juicy, tender and just down right good.The mac and cheese wasn't too cheesy but it had a nice pepper season to it... it was delicious. Because we got our order to go they put the sauce on the side so we can pour it on to our liking. I use the whole of sauce. It's sweet but with a spicy lil kick/aftertaste. I know of very few BBQ spots that have left a positive taste in my mouth and this is one for future reference to hit up if I'm looking for a good hole in the wall BBQ spot.\",\n",

       " u\"Del Taco is the best fast food taco place by far..this place blows Taco H(b)ell out of the water, and two Del Classic Chicken Burritos for 5 bucks. INSANE!!!!\\n\\nSo I had a craving the other night around 1:30 in the morning so I started to think outside the box...:) then I remembered!!! Read my reviews of Taco Bell for further explanation. \\n\\nSo Jack in the box's grease filled 99 cent tacos just didn't seem appealing to me. So I drove way out of my way to go to the nearest Del Taco. So I got the 2 Del classic Chicken burritos and two chicken soft taco's they were all delicious, and they also have these new jalapeno rings which are like onion rings except they are hot jalapenos they are so good. I am seriously hooked on these bad boys!!!\\n\\nAll in all Del Taco filled the void that was in my stomach. I really enjoyed this place would have to say this is more of like a 3 and a half star place though the do lose some stars because It took a while to make my order for a fast food joint and was still a bit pricey besides the 2 for 5 deal. Yelp needs a half a star system. I would say 3 1/2 stars!!\",\n",

Yes this happened. Taco Bell should be sued for complete misprepresentation!!\\n\\nMEANWHILE at Del Taco..... \\n\\n39 cents for a balanced taco with a decent amount of cheese and delicious medium (\"Scorcho\") sauce --- THE CHOICE IS CLEAR. Plus the deluxe tacos are CHOCK FULL. I usually get 4 regular tacos and end with 2 deluxe ones.\\nI\\'ve had the double cheeseburger once, nothing impressive there. It wants to be an In \\'n\\' Out Double-Double, but it falls short, like when you were a kid and wanted Levi\\'s 505\\'s for Christmas and end up getting Sears jeans.\\nCome for the cheap tacos and LOAD UP I SAY!\\nThe burritos are OK too.',\n",

       " u\"We've been going here for 20 years and love the place. The machaca is great, the whole bean burritos are good, as are the potato and bean burros. The chili rellanos are good. The salads are only OK.  All salsas and sauces are made that day and are fresh. Beans aren't cooked with lard, but are cooked with vegetable oil. Portions are small, taste is flavorful. Rosa the server/owner is friendly  and Maria her mother is the cook.\",\n",
       " u\"Great atmosphere and simple, good Mexican food. Some reviews cite mediocre food, but I've always found my enchiladas perfectly cooked, my chile relleno nice and crisp, and the machaca in my chimichanga nothing but savory. \\n\\nYou won't be blown away by the food, but it's all SOLID, and a step up from most burrito places or diner-style Mexican. The restaurant can be small and you can find yourself waiting 30 minutes for your order to come out during the lunch rush, but it's a breath of fresh air to walk into such a simple, unpretentious restaurant run by a woman and her mother.\",\n",
       " u\"Honestly I go here rarely.  My recent visit was to watch my godson while his parents were doing family picture photo shoot in the Chinese gardens and pond areas.  You can walk the whole cultural center and its gardens in 10 minutes, so there isn't alot of sightseeing here.  But to get a little glimpse of some replica gardens and seating structures from China, where else to go?  So 4 stars for the somewhat idyllic gardens in back behind the shopping plaza, cuz there isn't any other place in the valley like it.\",\n",
       " u'Always a fun visit....typically for the Lunar New Year celebration, but also for the Full Moon festival in Autumn any time is good to visit...great year round shopping and Asian market.',\n",
       " u\"Maybe it was just me but this place was a bit of a let down.\\n\\nThe bakery was passable and I found the food selection to be inferior to Mekong, Lee Lee's, and Asiana Market in Mesa and Tempe.\\n\\nThe Chinese Culture part is a bit of joke really, if culture can be absorbed by walking through oriental themed buildings and the grocery. \\n\\nOne could glean more Chinese Culture in Chandler imo\",\n",
       " u'Phoenix has a large but scattered population. I\\'m not sure why developers picked this location for a Chinese Culture Center.  It doesn\\'t make sense to me as the area around Dobson might seem more appropriate.\\n\\nThe center seems like it\\'d have potential if it gave incentive for small businesses to set up shop and stay.  I\\'ve heard the lunar festival held here charged admission and was dismal.  It\\'s now not much more than a nearly-empty strip mall with \"Asian\" architecture.  I live up the street and would rather drive to Mesa/Chandler for anything Asian. Sad because I hoped Phoenix could do better.',\n",
       " u\"Check out the Dorayaki at the Ranch Market, if you get there on time, they make a red bean paste pancake on a griddle in front of the store. Deelish! Go to the Szechwan Palace and request the non-English menu for the true authentic items. The gift shop has tons of gift ideas if you are stumped. I might also mention they have some really, really nice shrines made out of cherry wood and lacquer. I was in the market for one to make my altar and these are the real deal. Beautiful furniture finds, although they can be a bit pricey. They are willing to negotiate with you if you ask. \\n\\nThe store has what you need but the variety may seem lacking in comparison to Lee Lee's or Mekong. Anything you try at the bakery is amazing, if you are in the mood for perfect deco-den like whipped cream cakes, this is the place to get it. Their fruit selection is lacking which is probably my only gripe, but they make up for it in their vegetable selection. The Chinese Herb shop next door is a great place if you are into holistic/Chinese medicine. I wish this place was bigger with more stores, that would definitely put it over the top.\",\n",
       " u'Great authentic Chinese menu.  Thank you Helen for translating the menu!  My significant other will be able to go there & order off the Chinese menu now!\\n\\nI like the rice cakes.

       " u\"Alex A. was craving some Chinese food, so we headed over to the Chinese Cultural Center and decided on trying Lao Ching Hing. I should first say that I'm from an area that's saturated with Chinese restaurants, so I have pretty high standards for Chinese food. Lao Ching Hing fell far short of those standards. \\n\\nAt first glance, it seemed like a pretty nice restaurant. They invested a lot in very nice traditional-looking furniture, which I don't see often. So I enjoyed the overall atmosphere of the place. We were the only patrons when we went, so I can't really complain of bad service since we were the only ones being served.\\n\\nWe ordered the stir-fried string beans (my all-time favorite dish) and the salt and pepper pork. They were both so bad :( The string beans were under-seasoned and not really cooked the way it should have been cooked. In that particular dish, the beans should have been dried. It seems like they sort of skipped that step or didn't complete that step. So instead of nice crunchy beans, we got squeaky beans. The pork chops were worse though. I'm thinking it was at least a day old - you could taste the old oil - and they probably just re-heated it (we definitely heard a microwave go off). And that old oil taste stayed in my mouth long after dinner was over. Not pleasant.\\n\\nI think Panda Express has better-quality food than this place. I will not be returning.\",\n",
       " u'Ancient Chinese secret my ass.  I know the secret here and it\\'s my formula for success all through college.  You take some meat, add veggies, and make an oyster sauce rue and viola, instant \"authentic\" Chinese food.  We ordered several random dishes here and it was all the same.  I was pining for some Panda after this...ugh.  Only if this was being cooked by midgets on donkeys in an outdoor kitchen then yes, instant classic.',\n",
       " u\"If you want to try one of teh best home-made mole negro dishes in town, this is the place. The food is outstanding. Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because it's a tiny hole in the wall that tends to be crowded and very noisy at peak hours. If you like great, real Mexican food, though, this place is hard to beat. So are the prices, by the way.\",\n",
       " u\"One of if not the best torta Cubana in town. For a little coin it's almost to much food to finish.\",\n",
       " u'This place is cheap and great!  Best pastor tacos in Phoenix for the money!',\n",
       " u'My experience here this past weekend was mediocre at best.  I arrived at the Chinese Cultural Center at about 4pm, after Dim Sum had ended at the Golden Buddha, so I decided to give this place a try with my Taiwanese boyfriend and visiting family.  The prices were a bit of a rip off for the portions that were served.  I order the vegetarian chow fun for $1 extra than it would have been as \"chow mein.\"  I\\'m assuming we just received the American menu, but who knows?  The service was conducted half in English and half in Chinese, which is typical when our mixed race party shows up at a Chinese restaurant.  I sampled the lemon shrimp my father ordered.  The sauce was a bit too sugary, like lemon drops, and the shrimp itself had such a thick, hard shell of batter that it was hard to taste the shrimp.  No drinks were suggested; we were left with only the water that was refilled every 5 minutes.  When we boxed up some leftovers, they did not give us the rice to take home, which makes me wary that it is being re-used.  A child was with us, and there was no kid\\'s menu, which was a bit of a disappointment.  The food overall tasted alright, but I have definitely had better (and better service too!)  Nice try, but I\\'ll stick with the Golden Buddha or something closer to Chandler.',\n",
       " u'Side note: Szechwan province is one of the best places for spicy food in China\\n\\nDisclaimer: We are HUGE fans of spicy food. So unless you enjoy burning sensations on your palate, you might not like food items I\\'m mentioning here.\\n\\nI\\'ve been here many many times with my Chinese friends and roommates, so obviously they are always the ones who order. Our typical fare includes\" a big bowl soup to share, a cold dish #1 (which means something husband and wife - includes beef tongue, stomach, etc in oil, herbs, chilies and roasted peanuts ), spicy chicken with bone in, any of spicy beef or pork dish, and some sort of stir fried veggie. \\n\\nWe love the food here and think it\\'s pretty authentic - which also means that some can be very very oily.',\n",
       " u\"I think this might be a new Chinese place I need to go back and try some more. First of all, AUTHENTIC Sichuan dishes! Not just in name only! Holy cow! I picked up my parents from the airport and we decided to give this place a try since they were always disappointed at Golden Buddha. What is this? Water boiled XXXX? Last time I had that was visiting family in China! Ordered Water boiled fish and twice cooked pork. I really like the flavoring of the twice cooked pork. I wanted to order the Yu-shan pork but was overruled by parents. Oh well. They didn't want spicy, so the water boiled fish wasn't after the told the waiter not to make it spicy. Guess I'll have to try again. So, definitely more dishes I need to try. For now, I am happy that there's an authentic sichuan food place in Phoenix and not just the lame old American Chinese that are so totally boring. I am so very disappointed that the Shanghai place next to Golden Buddha has changed owner and they no longer have the special Shanghai menu and the quality of the food has gone down the drain.\\n\\nUpdate:\\nTried the water boiled pork. That I thought was pretty good. The meat was nice and tender. The sichuan peppercorn made everything taste lemony to me later on, including the water. I guess that must be the numbing effect people talk about. I also liked the beef with jalapeno pepper. Nice flavor. And I still really like the twice cooked pork.\\n\\nI think the restaurant would be better served if they got some more comfortable chairs instead of the unpadded straight back wooden wobbly chairs they have now.\",\n",
       " u'In short: I got a run of the mill Chinese meal here, but I didn\\'t know to ask for the \"real\" menu. Service was excellent for as busy as they were.\\n\\nSo I went to the Chinese Cultural center on Sunday, Chinese New Year, looking for Chinese culture. I found a street fair with such cultural gems as a booth for Wells Fargo loans, and one selling \"crazy Chinese hats.\" I wanted authentic food, and the booths selling egg rolls and stuff from the market buffet were pretty much the opposite of what I was there for. So my date for the event and I decided to try one of the Chinese restaurants at the center, and I chose Szechwan Palace because I was in the mood for something spicy.\\n\\nThe place was packed, which was to be expected. Since a good portion of the conversation I heard taking place was in Chinese, I was hopeful that that this would be an experience similar to what I\\'d get in Seattle\\'s international district. I knew that wouldn\\'t be the case when I saw the menu, which was basically the same menu you\\'ll find in any americanized Chinese restaurant.\\n\\nSo we just ordered the Szechwan dinner for two. Hot & sour soup, crab rangoons, fried rice, general tso\\'s chicken, szechwan shrimp, and a rice based desert that I forget the name of. I thought all the dishes were decent, but nothing had the spice I expect from Szechwan cooking.\\n\\nAfter consulting Yelp, I know now there is a \"real\" Chinese menu here. That explains why this place could be so popular with native speakers. I wish I had known. This review reflects the disappointing experience I had with the menu I was presented with.',\n",

       " u'The food is great. The ambiance is nice.\\nWe went on a Saturday night and it was very crowded.\\nThe service could have been better. Our appetizers did not come all together. In fact one of our appetizers arrived after the entrees. (We did remind the waiters a few times but still no avail). We had to wait a long time for each of our dishes. In fact that is one of the main reasons I gave this place 3 stars.',\n",
       " u\"My family's been coming to this place for years, and it used to be one of my favorite restaurants! Then we heard their head chef left a few years ago, and the quality wasn't as good anymore. Nevertheless, we were in the area last week and decided to try them out again. Came for dinner, and the place was pretty full! (Although, apparently the other restaurants in the plaza had closed down so it could just be due to lack of choice). \\n\\nWe ordered our usual dishes, and they were still pretty good! The only disappointment was the cold noodles: They were pretty flavorless, and completely different from before. But the Chongqing Chicken (Bone-In) was still crispy and flavorful! However, the portion was much smaller than in the past. Another favorite of ours is the stir-fried green pepper potato strips, which didn't disappoint. Overall a solid spot to go for some authentic Szechwan cuisine.\",\n",
       " u\"Went in and was promptly seated.  Someone came over and dumped water in our cups (with attitude) and walked away.  15 minutes later no one had come to get our order, others who sat down after us had ordered already.  Felt like maybe we were not served because we were not asian, as almost everyone else in the restaurant was.  Cant say for sure,.  The only time anyone talked to us was to ask if there were two for dinner before we sat down.  Disappointed because we were really looking forward to trying something different and authentic (menu looked good) - ended up walking out and going to tempe marketplace for dinner instead.  Apparently they didn't want to serve us.\",\n",

The first time we went the service was terrible, but the great food brought us back.  \\n\\nWe visited the Palace again last night and it was 100% better.  We had a gentlemen as our server and he was humorous and very tentative to our party's needs.  We ordered our food and 5 minutes later we had all four dishes in front of us (fresh and not pre-made).  My personal favorite is Szechwan chicken.  However, everything we had was great.  The food is very good quality Chinese food and it isn't overly greasy.  I love Chinese food, but it doesn't always love me back (if you know what i mean)!

We started to settle into a spot but got interrupted by a waitress who then seated us. Make up your mind people.  Menus came fast but without a drink order, we were both very thirsty as it was over 100 out side.  We also had to wait a bit long for the food order.  The staff seemed to pointedly ignore us and walk past our table again and again.  Our waitress eventually came to check on us but was so intent on speedily asking a quick question she started to walk away without a drink order again, we had to stop her.  \\n\\nFood came promptly, with our drinks, but it tasted so so at best, about take out quality.  We chugged through the waters and soda very quick but the empty glasses sat at the edge of the table until we finally had to hold up an empty glass and yell over for someone to bring refills. Rude yes, but nothing else got any kind of attention.  \\n\\nAfter we were done, yep you guessed it, waited forever for the check.  No excuse for a place with people at only 10% of the tables.\\n\\nAnother big issue:  They have a yelp coupon for checking in, even though it was presented at time of ordering, they WOULD NOT HONOR IT!!\\n\\nBad service, so so food and dishonest representation.  And we had been trying to get there for a long time.   At least it was cheap.\\n\\nUpdate:  We were contacted by the manager regarding the coupon not being honored.  They said it was only for the dinner service.  Problem is, the coupon did NOT state that.  This makes it false advertising and constitutes fraud in my book.  Its called \"bait and switch\" draw them in with a false ad.  That only makes me feel worse about this place, can I take the one star back?',\n",

       " u'Right after I was about to order a 2nd round of drinks, the nitwits at this place kicked my date out after falsely claiming she was there a week ago during the ASU game causing a ruckus and skipping out on her bill.  The tatted up short order cook (those are the only jobs you will get kids if you get tats) and the once friendly female pudgy bartender were convinced that she was the enemy and must go despite us telling her that she wasn\\'t here during that game. This was a bad case of mistaken identity and if your gonna accuse somebody of that at least have a photo, more proof or something other than, \"you have to call the owner\". If you really recognized her as the person who ripped you off then call the cops man. These two were off their rocker. Well, at least its the last time I have to watch the \"cook\" scoop out potato salad from the giant tub and fry up nasty frozen fish on fish friday.',\n",
       " u'I guess you can certainly do worse.. , after awhile all these shitholes look the same to me, I go for the experience of talking to the locals, and , on this day my better half and I were the only 2 customers in this place. We had a serviceable Philly Cheese Steak. Prices are average I guess. And I have to give it one star for the stupid name.',\n",

       " u\"Not sure how to describe this place other than average in certain areas and below par in other areas. The salad section has all the usual ingredients and they were fresh and well-stocked right after the lunch rush. I could clearly make a great salad and they had fat-free dressings which is good for my health kick of late. Once you get beyond the salads, your kind of on your own with more misses than hits. The soups were unimpressive that day, sans for a semi-decent beef vegetable soup, but the rice in the chicken rice soup was way overcooked and mushy. Then you had all the salads that were loaded down with mayo - about five of them, none of which looked appetizing. Baked Potatoes, mac n chese, tacos, cracker pizza , all of these should be eaten at your own risk. Most of the bread didn't cut the mustard either, except for an average garlic breadstick. Desert was the usual stuff like jello and pudding and frozen ice cream? from the ole machine. At $6 with a coupon, there is nothing wrong with going here for a good salad, but beyond that, it seems like a crapshoot.\",\n",

       " u\"Pozoleria Guerrero is another little Mexican in the near-central Phoenix area.  Definitely not a bad experience and the atmosphere inside is a lot more pleasant than you would assume when driving by (think shady area).  Of course, this is the case with many of Phoenix's best Mexican spots.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere inside was nice, the server was really friendly and helped out almost immediately.  Pozoleria Guerrero is open on Sundays which is nice as well.\\n\\nThe menu is fairly extensive, including the usual assortment of tacos, tortas, burritos, quesadillas, and of course pozole.  I decided to go with their specialty and got the pozole Rojo.  For those who don't know what pozole is, it's a type of pork stew that has little pieces of hominy blended in.  The spicing is excellent, and it left me with a runny nose.  A normal bowl will run you $7.25.  Other items on the menu were reasonable, with tacos ranging from a buck to $1.25.\\n\\nThe salsa was interesting and really spicy but good as well, although the chips were thin and left something to be desired.\\n\\nAll in all Pozoleria Guerrero #1 was a decent spot and I think it comes down to whether you want to get pozole.  In the future if I get a hankering I will definitely be returning.  I can't comment on the tacos, etc. yet, but plan to try them in the future!\",\n",

He pulled up a chair and chatted AT us on three different occasions.  When I ordered my food he insisted that I order something different.  When I finally got my food it was mediocre at best.  \\n\\nThe manager was also having a meeting with two new employees at a near by table, so we had to listen to all the Applebee\\'s rules and regulations.  Let me tell you, there are a lot of them. The manager\\'s list went on and on for our entire meal  Almost, every sentence started with \"I can\\'t\" or  \"You can\\'t\".

I hadn't heard any fantastic about this place, but nothing horrible either. \\n\\nI had the lunch special with 1/2 sandwich and salad for around $7.00. I got the #7 sandwich which has three different Italian meats, cheese, lettuce, tomato, peppercinis, and a oil type sauce. It was awesome! The bread was toasted and the perfect combination of crunchy and soft. The Caesar was pretty standard, but tasty none the less. \\n\\nThis place is close to work and I'm sure we'll be back sometime soon.\",\n",
       " u'I had not been here for a few years but glad that I decided to come back.  I had their penne pasta with meat sauce and it was a huge portion with great flavor.  I really like their red sauce, it had a lot of flavor and was rich.  My bf had their meatball sub which again was a huge portion and he liked it a lot.  Next time we come back we will have to try their pizza!  Great job and keeping up with the times Streets of NY!',\n",
       " u'We ordered wings, boneless, Buffalo. Just a little bit before happy hour ended. We decided not to get pizza and do pasta and a sub.  We got our \"wings\" which were black, round little crispy balls of dry chicken with Italian dressing g with some hotsauce mixed in drizzled on top. I couldn\\'t chew them so I sent them back. When we got our new wings they looked a million times better. They were golden and smothered in some of the same weird sauce. These were still partially frozen. I didn\\'t bother sending them back for fear they\\'d spit in my raviolis. My boyfriend ordered a Philly I ordered raviolis.  His sandwich was sub par. He said it was just some beef, melted processed provolone cheese on a dry sesame bun. Bummer, then my raviolis were big and round, the filling was nearly flavorless, obviously frozen and processed swimming in some sauce that was as tick as ketchup with a taste to match. We waited a long time between refilled and when they asked how my food was I told them it was gross. She left it at the table and brought the check about ten minutes later. With the wings and ravioli included! We wont be going back...to any of this chain and I dont recommend it. If you want a NY slice and some yummy wings go to pats pizza plus.

In addition to the nummy little thing being just the right amount for under $1.50, you can get it at 3:00 a.m. when there is no hope of finding such a treat elsewhere.\\n\\nYou will never catch me having a crispy shrimp taco (the idea of seafood from a fast food place makes me want to hack), but holy bajeebus... that cake is like crack!',\n",
       " u\"Once again, everyone is going nuts over anything Chris Bianco touches.  Look, these sandwiches are good - I had a salami and cheese, and my friend had a roated eggplant.  Tried them both, and they are better than something I can make at home.  However, if I wanted to sit at a picnic table breathing in exhaust from Central Ave traffic - well, I wouldn't actually.  the sandwich would have been better if they had real tables - either indoor or on a protected patio, not a homemade bench in a parking lot.\",\n",
       " u\"Pane Bianco doesn't offer a crazy-big menu, but you won't care about a huge selection after you take the first bite of your sandwich or salad. A brick oven in the center of the restaurant ensures fresh bread on a daily basis. It's crispy, chewy and delicious. \\n\\nThe Market Sandwich varies on availability and price depending on what's fresh for whatever time of year you choose to dine there. You can purchase entire loaves of their famous sandwich bread to share with others or greedily scarf it down in a dark corner somewhere in a manner not unlike that of a starving badger.\\n\\nBe prepared for a bit of a wait during the lunch time hours of the Monday - Friday white collar work week. The secret is out, but it's definitely worth the wait.\",\n",
       " u\"At first, I was a little disappointed in the menu selection. Only three sandwiches plus two daily specials? And then, no normal drinks? All a brother wanted was a diet coke but they . . .didn't carry coke or pepsi? What kind of restaurant was this?\\n\\nAs it turned out, a damn good one. And then I realized, how dare I presume I will know better what I want to eat than Chris Bianco, my favorite chef and purveyor of restaurants in the Valley? It would be like telling your favorite band how to play their instruments.\\n\\nIt makes much more sense, and works out much better in the end, if you just let them do what they do and sample the final product. \\n\\nAnd the no coca cola, by the way, is a great call. They have an entirely organic alternative with no caffeine called China Soda that was more than satisfactory. \\n\\nSo if you're not sure, ask whoever is working for a recommendation and trust that Bianco will deliver.\",\n",
       " u\"MMMMMMM.. sandwiches......\\n\\nAnytime I hear mention of pane bianco.. my mouth waters.  That remarkably simple and successful formula that has made Pizzeria Bianco so famous, has once again been executed to perfection in this little restaurant off of central.  \\nThey are only open for lunch(  11am-3pm), and I recommend avoiding stopping by during the height of lunch hour.  On a side note, there is no indoor dining.  Seating is limited to wooden tables and benches out front that are shared with the customers of Lux. \\n\\nI always introduce friends and co-workers to this place.  and everytime we leave its the same reaction.... Wow!  During my last visit to Pane Bianco, I took a co-worker who had never been there.  while we were waiting, the owner comes rolling in with a basket of fresh veggies that looked amazing.  Does he grow this in his garden?  Did he sign a deal with the devil?  I dont know how he does it.  \\n\\nI usually go for the Mozzarella, Local Tomato & Basil sandwich.  This thing is crazy delicious.  And when people say fresh, they mean it.  Its perfect and the bread is insanely delicious (chewy and crunchy all at the same time).  The same goes for any sandwich you might choose here.\\nAlso, if you love to just chow on some fresh baked bread like I do, grab a baguette.  they are $3 and can't be beat.\\n\\nThis place is a winner and you will be glad you tried it\",\n",
       " u\"THE best sandwich. I've tried all of the few options, but the mozza is the best. Don't even worry about anything else. Fresh mozzarella made on the premises -- and some of the best damn bread.\\n\\nAbsolutely fresh ingredients -- and many are locally grown!\\n\\nAt $8 a sandwich, it's a little expensive, but you can share . . . and totally worth it. Best. Sandwich. In Phoenix.\\n\\nGo for take-away or just walk across the street to Steele Indian School Park for an impromptu picnic.\",\n",
       " u\"This place is awesome. \\n\\nFor the guy who said you should go to Safeway instead for a sandwich, well, I'm guessing he probably thinks a steak at Applebees rivals a steak at City Hall. \\n\\nIf you like turkey with mayo and mustard, you can't get that here. If you like to try new things with fresh ingredients, you might want to give this a try. Yes during the summer it is hot and they only have outdoor seating, but how about taking it to go and eating in your car? I've done in many times. \\n\\nAs I say in my Pizzeria Bianco review, I now live in NYC but will take extended layovers in Phoenix gladly to stop at these two places. I have also scheduled meetings around these places being open! It's THAT good!\",\n",
       " u'As any normal person would when trying a place that has 4.5 stars based on 70 reviews (and that just *happens* to be related to the notorious Pizzeria Bianco, where people wait hours upon hours for pizza), I had very high expectations for Pane Bianco. I expected to bite into my sandwich and be wowed. While I really enjoyed the mozzarella and soppressata sandwiches we split and certainly found them both more enjoyable than many sandwiches I have had in the Phoenix area, I just don\\'t think this place is deserving of the Salvation Army of fans that seems to be willing to fight a holy war for that mozzarella sandwich. \\n\\nIn my eyes, what makes Pane Bianco\\'s sandwiches good (and still worthy of 3 stars) is the fact that they are simple. Unlike some yuppy establishments where Arcadia ladies \"lunch\" (think Wildflower, Acacia Cafe or Chelsea\\'s Kitchen), Pane Bianco (and by the transitive property, Chris Bianco) clearly has the European sensibility of \"less is more.\" A sandwich doesn\\'t need to be piled high with garlic aioli, carmelized onions, and herb goat cheese to be good. If the ingredients are high enough quality, the bread and a few fillings should be able to stand alone and make for a great sandwich. \\n\\nI guess that\\'s where my problem with Pane Bianco comes in. The individual ingredients of the sandwiches just weren\\'t that great. Certainly, the mozzarella is good but I have had better mozzarella from nice local grocery stores and of course, at countless Italian places. I also agree with Kristin S that the soppressata was overly salty, which obscured the flavor. Finally, I didn\\'t think the bread was as delicious as I had pictured it would be many times before actually coming. It certainly tasted fresh but I thought it could have a bit more flavor complexity (as it was, it tasted very white-bread and didn\\'t have the slightly sour kick that housmade bread often does. \\n\\nI\\'ve got to be honest that after trying Pane Bianco, I am convinced that I would be a bit disappointed if I waited in line to eat at PIzzeria Bianco. While I can definitely appreciate a simple but delicious Pizza Margherita in a world where buffalo chicken pizza is somehow an appealing dish, the individual pizza ingredients would have to be better than the ones at Pane Bianco for me to truly feel like the wait was worth it.',\n",
       " u\"This place keeps it simple.  Only a few things on the menu, but it's all delicious!  Right next to lux, so you can get an iced chai with your tomato/mozzarella sandwich.  Yum!!!\",\n",
       " u\"The sandwiches were amazing.  My friend and I ordered the soppressata and the tomato, basil, mozzarella to share.  The sandwiches were so fresh.  The ingredients tasted crispy and complimented very well.  I understand the limited menu is so that they can focus on producing less at greater quality but I am so curious to see what else they could put together.  And I kinda wish there was a little more shade outside in the eating area.  It happened to be a hot day amd my cream soda got warm fast and eating a hot sandwich in the sun isn't so easy.\",\n",
       " u\"I visited this restaurant because of the reputation of it's parent restaurant, Pizzeria Bianco. \\n\\nThe Sandwich I had was excellent, mostly because of the fresh bread they used but also the high quality cheese. They lose one star only because of the limited menu, particularly for vegetarians.\",\n",
       " u'These sandwiches are so good, I would be willing to sit outside on those 115-degree days Phoenix supposedly gets, if that was the only way I could enjoy them. Combine it with Cowboy Ciao in Scottsdale and Cafe Elote in Sedona, and we pretty much had the perfect AZ food trifecta.\\n\\nBonus points for meeting Chris Bianco behind the counter. Yeah, I guess this place is named after him.',\n",
       " u\"This place is very simple, take-out only, three kinds of regular sandwiches with another special market sandwich, several kinds of salads, a few types of Italian soda or alike, that's all! It's that simple and quick, yet always packed. \\n\\nMy favorite is the mozzarella, tomato and basil sandwich. Freshly baked bread from the on-site brick oven with the home made mozzarella, fresh local tomato and basil, it's that simple and delicious!!! Trust me, $8 for a big and high-quality sandwich, you'll be very satisfied!\\n\\nOnly drawback is that it only opens for lunch, 11am-3pm, and only Tuesday - Saturday. Maybe that's why people keep going back!\",\n",
       " u'If Pizzeria Bianco is so ballyhooed about that it has an almost mythic status... then Pane Bianco could almost be seen as the less famous step-child of the family. Here is an analogy for you... I hope you remember how these work from your high school days:\\n\\nAlec Baldwin is to Stephen Baldwin as Pizzeria Bianco is to ______?\\n\\n...how did you do? \\n\\nIf you filled in the blank with \"Pane Bianco\", then congratulations... give yourself a pat on the back and 3 extra credit points. \\n\\nJust a hop, skip and a jump north of downtown Phoenix lies this little unassuming storefront. If you didn\\'t know any better, you\\'d never guess that some of tastiest sandwiches in the valley are being cooked up inside. Similar to Pizzeria Bianco, there is a focus on fresh local ingredients and simplicity. Don\\'t expect a dazzling and varied menu, but do expect a small selection of sandwiches which they really know how to cook well. I always love it when a place has a small menu of things that they do great, rather than an extensive menu of things they do just OK. \\n\\nLast time we went, we were able to get one of each sandwich on the menu (it\\'s not as impressive as it sounds... they only have three sandwiches along with one rotating special). Each one had unique flavor and tasted really fresh.... our favorite might be the simplest one they have; the mozzarella/tomato/basil sandwich... yum yum. They have a way of always cooking the bread perfectly, so it has this slightly burnt crisp to it; it\\'s almost like you\\'re eating a sandwich made out of really good pizza crust.\\n\\nThere\\'s really not too much bad to say about this place, they serve great fresh sandwiches for a pretty reasonable price. If you do go though, there is occasionally a little bit of a wait... and it\\'s strictly a \\'to-go\\' place, so there\\'s no indoor seating (there are picnic tables outside in the front). If you do have a little wait time to get your food, be sure to go next door to Lux where you can get a pretty good cup of coffee/tea and laugh at the sheer volume of trendy hipsters completely enamored in their MacBooks. \\n\\n4.25/5.',\n",
       " u'Love the sandwiches!  The bread is really what makes these things.  Grab an old school coca cola next door at the coffee shop (the kind made with real sugar cane).  Soppressata sandwich and coca-cola=killer lunch combo.',\n",
       " u\"I wanted to hate this place.  There isn't that much parking.  It is packed with only a few big picnic tables to sit outside and eat.  It was to hot to eat outside, IMO which meant I had to take my sandwhich to go.  There were only 4 sandwiches and 3 salads to choose from.  One dessert they were sold out of.  The price was high- $8 for a sandwich with no sides.\\n\\nHowever, once I took my first bite of the tomatoe, basil, mozzarella sandwich I was in HEAVEN.  The perfect amount of each ingredient.  They have perfected the sandwich!!  I have been craving it ever since.  I will stop by for lunch EVERYTIME I am in the area.  I will bring everyone I know to eat here!  Seriously!\",\n",
       " u'The look and taste of organic food without any of the philosophy behind it....and the bread is very difficult to sink your teeth into.\\n\\nI know...I know...I just berated your favorite sandwich shop. But really, this is your favorite place because either (1) your options are so limited in the area or (2) you require a feeling of prestige to eat.\\n\\nIt\\'s good to be organic. The ingredients taste delicious. I don\\'t even mind paying $10 for a vegetarian sandwich that tastes good (albeit difficult to eat) and a water for lunch. But what bothers me is the mixed message that\\'s more like false advertizing. \\n\\nFirst there is no place to sit inside at all. So chances are, you\\'re getting this meal to-go (with all the packaging that entails). There\\'s outdoor seating that is shared with Cafe Lux (fair trade cafe that\\'s awesome but similarly expensive). Seating is not available at typical eating times and lines may be long.\\n\\nSecond, you cannot order a beverage from the US, Mexico or anywhere that it might arrive in even a remotely sustainable way. All their drinks are from Italy. There\\'s no option for fountain drinks or even local bottled water. If you ask for a drink that hasn\\'t traveled 5,000 miles to be here, they point you to a water cooler  in the cafe next door.\\n\\nThird, the service sucks. There are plenty of people working there, almost tripping over each other politely trying to not infringe of anyone\\'s  space  by trying to use the cash register.\\n\\nFourth,  The decoration is designed to make you feel like it\\'s sustainable from recycled organic materials. They even offer an organic tote bag for sale ($10).  This is their attempt to offer a solution for all the waste created by the perpetual to-go-ness. It\\'s almost like they\\'re laughing at you calling you an \"idiot\".  We can call this \\'the bleeding heart tax\\'. If you forgot your recycled to-go bag at home, they can give you another one for the price of two meals.\\n\\nFifth and finally, the bread is hard to eat. So you can\\'t take a bite of your sandwich without it falling apart a bit. There are no silverware to save you from the embarrassment of using your hands. The wrapping is brown paper with very thick wax paper lining, so you can\\'t use it to wrap around your sandwich to keep it together while you\\'re trying to tear pieces of the bread off with your teeth.\\n\\nBut they give you a sweet with every order....and if you decide to come back with your empty glass bottle from Italy, they will recycle it for you.  --And if you start coming here regularly you will look very hip when the people who work there remember your name, order and the fact that you do not require a boutique to-go bag.\\n\\nI\\'d eat from there again, if you pick up the order and return the empty Italian bottles for me.',\n",

       " u'I work in the area and don\\'t always have time, or care, to pack my own lunch.  Plus I don\\'t cook and you can only eat spaghetti so many times a week. \\n\\nThis is why I love The Duck.  It\\'s two blocks from my work which gives me a little \"wake me up\" walk and the outdoor seating is nice on the days when it\\'s not too hot.  Yeah a sandwich will run you just under $10 with a drink but you get a massively huge sandwich.  Some days, I end up taking half of it home and eating it later.  \\n\\nI always get their Avocado sandwich because I\\'m a vegetarian and it was so good the first time I was here that I\\'ve been unable to try anything else lest it not compare.  Co-workers of mine are fans of the curry chicken salad.  \\n\\nThere is plenty of seating so I usually suggest this place when meeting friends for lunch.',\n",
       " u'If you build a good sandwich, they will come...If you build a good sandwich anyway you want it, more will come...\\n\\nFresh and creative, these sandwiches are fast and delicious.  The sandwiches are prepared fresh to order and the staff are eager and willing to make it anyway you want it with no complaints.\\n\\nDid I mention free drink refills ALL DAY !!',\n",
       " u'Located in the holy bermuda triangle of awesomeness and light rail construction of central Phoenix, I had to try this place out. Wednesdays apparently they host a mod/soul dance night. Since I had to be around the Indian School \\'hood anyway, I figured-this is the time. Well, this must be one hell of a popular night to go-I had trouble finding parking in their huge lot! Only when I saw a group of young male hipsters go to their car around 11:30 did I score a spot...the farthest spot away from the pub!\\n\\nI entered the side door, I was greeted by pool tables and went straight to the bar. Lots of random guys at the bar and fabulously mod, blackhaired ladies smoking were gathered around but managed to get a stool and just got an Amstel light on the tip their other beers were price-y. I looked around, seeing the DJ spinning some James Brown with an old American Bandstand playing on the TV above him. Some ladies in A-line dresses and guys were R&Bing their way while holding lit cigarettes. A small dance floor for maybe 20 people, the rest were holding court at large booths, round tables and standing around in the back-pretty much a full house. I also spotted near the pool tables DARTS. And while they have the shitty electronic ones, I did spot an AUTHENTIC old-skool one wedged inbetween-I def. have to bring my dart set next time!\\n\\nThe crowd was friendly and guys from other dance nights I attend were there and we struck up an easy-going conversation-hard to hear sometimes since right next to the \"dance floor\". I don\\'t think there is much going on Wednesday nights-this is apprently \"it\". Some guys left to do Casey Moores, but since the dance floor wasn\\'t packed and the other tables were filled, I just left after one beer. I have no idea what this place is like other nights, but the bartenders were friendly and the general vibe of this place is laid-back but not cheezy.',\n",
       " u'A fun, laid-back bar where everything is worn, well loved, and comfortable.  The food is delicious and reasonably priced.  Went for lunch today.  Navigating the construction traffic was difficult, but worth it.  I ordered the Shepherds Pie (delicious comfort food!) and my friend ordered the fish and chips (likewise tasty!).  Massive beer selection, friendly waitresses, great atmosphere - definitely worth a try and I hope to get back again soon.',\n",
       " u\"I first fell in love with George & Dragon during World Cup 2002. On the night Brazil defeated England, the patrons actually lifted the one man with a Brazil jersey into the air and carried him to the back door.\\n\\nPeople often think G&D has overpriced drinks. It really doesn't. Last night, I bought $8 rounds of vodka tonic and Smithwick's pints. I don't know how the price was split, exactly, but $4 for either drink is decent.\\n\\nMonday's No Country Karaoke isn't much different from your average karaoke night, but a few genuinely talented crooners do show up, and the wireless mike makes the whole pub a stage.\\n\\nG&D's business has slowed because of light-rail construction on Central, but the fun factor still is there. I've never had a bad time. If singing and drinking isn't your thing, pool tables line one side of the pub. Also, a fenced outdoor patio allows smokers to have a puff while keeping their drinks in hand. Bravo.\",\n",
       " u'Loves it!\\n\\nNothing like the eery feeling that you might get raped in the parking lot to make a girl come back for more..... and that is precisely what I do. \\n\\nIts super close to home for one thing...walkable.  The food is actually pretty phenom. for \"bar food\" . Oddly they serve a chicken satay in some sort of peanut saucy fabulousness that is pretty damn amazing. The pool tables suck, but hey, I suck at pool, we\\'re even. Where else can you get hammered for 20.00 while wearing pajama bottoms and not feel the least bit out of place.\\n\\nIf you can get past the creepers that haven\\'t been laid in centuries and the distinct feeling that one or more of the waitstaff has probably been smoking meth all day I suggest you check it out. Just make sure you bring an escort ladies.',\n",
       " u\"At one point the George was a favorite haunt, a definite 5-star pub.  But times have changed.\\n\\nThe George used to feature the pinnacle of excellent service, excellent beverages and delicious comfort food.  Unfortunately what's done them in is their service.  The drinks and food are still exceptional, but the service level has faltered.\\n\\nReally, losing 2 whole stars for degraded service?  I went in again recently after about a year hiatus and I was unfortunately reminded.  Go for the drinks, the food, the darts (real or computer) or the pool... but not for the service.\",\n",
       " u\"My husband and I decided to check out George and Dragon last Sunday because it was such a nice day out and we wanted to do some day drinking at a place we hadn't been before. George and Dragon it was. The patio is long but narrow with only a handful of round tables on it. However, it's still a nice place to sit with a beer and chat. After a drink on the patio, we headed inside for our next round and decided to just cozy up to the bar. The inside decor is not going to wow you at all, but I appreciate the amount of TVs they have near the bar, showing everything from women's college basketball to English Premier League soccer. I'm also a big fan of bar sports, so the pool table and dart boards in the back get a thumbs up from me as well.\\n\\nThe draft beer selection is large...probably the largest of any of the pubs I have visited in the Valley. I believe it was about $4.75 for a pint, which is slightly cheaper than pubs like Rula Bula. The menu runs the gammet from traditional British fare to very Americanized food with very very moderate prices. Chris had a fish sandwich which he enjoyed and I had a BLT which I requested with no mayo. However, more than half way into the sandwich I realized there was mayo on it! This shocked me because normally I can always detect mayo on sandwiches as I hate it so much...so I'm not sure what G&D did, but they snuck mayo past me and I still loved the sandwich! The fries that came with the sandwiches were tasty. Our bill  (before tip) after five pints of beer, an appetizer, and two sandwiches came to $40.\\n\\nThe two bartenders that waited on us were incredibly friendly and quick. From the signs I saw inside, it looks like Sunday-Thursday, they do a reverse happy hour starting at 11 pm with 2 for 1 well drinks. I love the laid back vibe of G&D and the booths look comfy, so I will be back.\",\n",
       " u'I\\'ve always wanted to try this place after I heard their weird radio commercials a few years back.  It always cracked me up whenever the guy talked about the bangers and mash.  We finally stopped by one day after a lovely little trip on the lightrail.\\n\\nThe entrance is a little confusing being on the south side of the building.  I guess this is because I am used to entrances being in the fronts of buildings as opposed to on the side.  When you walk in, you see everything you expect.  A couple pool tables, dingy floors, a seedy looking bar, and tables and chairs scattered about.  There are a decent amount of booths as well.  One thing that I noticed and considered a bit odd was the fact that a third of the restaurant seemed to be sort of partitioned off for the \"fancy\" dining area.  I don\\'t know if that is the case, but it definitely looked that way.  When it comes down to it, this place is a classically tacky pub type restaurant, and I like it.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the food is not so great.  Neither is the bitchy service you get when you come in.  A half smile would be a welcome gesture instead of a perfect view of my server skulking in the kitchen.  I\\'m not sure what was up with that.  Maybe PMS.  The husband ordered the bangers and mash and I got the cornish pastie.  The husband mentioned that he had to add a lot of salt to his gravy, but he seemed to enjoy his meal.  Me on the other hand, not so much.  My gigantic pile of peas that kept rolling of my plate were cold and had a few hairs in them.  They definitely weren\\'t mine, I checked.  The pastie was delicious, and I really liked it, but the accompanying mashed potatoes were too thick and lumpy to be any good.\\n\\nThis place just isn\\'t good enough.  Hair in food is just plain gross.  Mediocre food combined with rude service is not going to get me to come back.  Besides, I am sick and tired of hearing the owner of this place bitch and moan about the lightrail being a detriment to his business.  I don\\'t know how you can say that when the place is packed on a Sunday afternoon with no sporting events going on.',\n",
       " u'I like the G&D.  The food is good, the waitresses are pretty, its a fun atmosphere.\\nI always like the shepards pie but there are lots of tasty things about and some of them are hard to find outside of Britain. (Try the scotch egg if you feel adventurous).',\n",
       " u\"I've been going here for years. See in 1999 I went to the UK on my first trip across the pond, came back missed it, and was invited to G&D. This place reminded me of what it was like in England and I loved it. The first couple of years my problem with going was the smoke but after Phoenix (& AZ) went smokefree the restaurant cleaned up quickly. \\n\\nThe left side is all pool tables and darts. My best friend and I spent many nights with a beer and a game of darts here. The right side is a restaurant section where you can sit down to have a great dinner. This section is large enough to easily accommodate a group dinner as we did often.\\n\\nThe beers here are great and the variety is exceptional. For the food, I always get the same exact thing. Shepherd Pie is my favorite, and I have seriously never had better (even in the UK). It's perfect with cheese & HP sauce. You just can't get any better than George & Dragon on Central.\",\n",
       " u\"DH & I went for dinner there tonight, we had a veggie pasty and the crust was nice & flaky but the stuffing of the pasty was tasteless, peas were tasteless, mashed potatoes & gravy, weren't very good either. Beer selection was good, but food was terrible.\",\n",
       " u\"I stopped by George and Dragon for lunch a couple of days ago. It was the first time I had been in the place for many years. Unfortunately, I was at work so I could not drink alcohol, but the food was great. I had fish and chips and my co-worker had bangers and mash. The fish was some of the best I've had, and the person with me enjoyed his food as well. The prices were decent, and the service was great. \\n\\nEven though I was not drinking this time, I could not help but notice the excellent selection of draft beers. I really wish I was closer so I could have some booze at this place. Alas, I live in Ahwatukee. \\n\\nFor those of you who are closer and enjoy the pub atmosphere, George and Dragon is highly recommended, though I imagine the place is a zoo when there's a big soccer match. The last time I was here I was not impressed, and had not been back since. But this last visit was wonderful. Either something changed, or I just caught them on a bad day last time.\",\n",
       " u'Hello all!  This place is great.  I went to high school right down the street and have lived in the neighborhood forever.  You can always have a good time.  Good atmosphere, great beer, and great location.\\n\\nWhy I didn\\'t give it 5 stars:  Well, they have this slay the dragon thing...if you can drink all the beers on this paper they give you, not all at once, although I guess I would try that...but, you are suppose to get a T-shirt that says, \"I slaid the Dragon\".  Well, the problem is, they don\\'t keep all the beers in stock so...boo.\\n\\nAlso, it kind of is a two-faced place...one Friday you\\'ll go there and you wont be able to park and there will be standing room only inside...but the next Friday it\\'s dead.\\n\\nBut, please go check it out, it\\'s really awesome and the owners are knows to mingle with the crowed, can\\'t miss them, they\\'re the ones with the English accents.  CHEERS!',\n",
       " u\"I've only been here once and it was OK. If you're into the English pub scene, you would probably like it since everything is decently priced. However, a friend of mine tells me that they broke into her car on a Friday night, smashed the window and all, so I would be careful about what you leave in your vehicle.\",\n",
       " u\"I've been to GND a couple of times and I am always pleased with the service there. The food is good, especially the shepard's pie, and the beer is cheap. I would recommend that people should check this place out and if you do you won't be disappointed.\",\n",
       " u'I\\'ve only been here once & so far I\\'m indifferent. If I never come back I\\'ll really only miss the coleslaw. The coleslaw got this place 3 stars instead of 2.\\n\\nA friend asked me to go on a Mon which is karaoke night. I don\\'t inflict my terrible singing on others, but I did enjoy most of the other people singing.\\n\\nI played a couple games of pool on 1 of the 2 tables while waiting for my food.\\n\\nThe main bartender was not a pleasant person. Words like \"sweetie\" don\\'t disguise impatient, judgmental body language. I can\\'t remember seeing her smile once. She made me uncomfortable. The other girls working there were smiley & nice looking. I also saw the general manager chilling outside.\\n\\nCall me a cheap ass but I feel like I paid too much for fish & chips. Came out to $14.02. I expected to pay $10ish. I know it\\'s market price & all but that still sucked. I should have asked the price before ordering.\\n\\nThe fish & chips were really good though. I could barely finish the 2 thick pieces of fish on my plate. They were perfectly crispy with just the right amount of batter. Chips could have been crispier though.\\n\\nI LOVE THE COLESLAW! I can\\'t say that enough. It wasn\\'t sweet (yuck!) like other coleslaws I\\'ve tried. It was crisp & peppery. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. Hmmm\\n\\nWhen you order a shot I think you get more liqueur than just a shot because of their glasses. They\\'re wide & the bartender wasn\\'t measuring, she just eye balled it. Don\\'t pay more ordering doubles since you\\'re probably pretty much already getting that originally.\\n\\nThere are heaters above on the patio. Your top 1/2 will be warm while your bottom 1/2 might get cold.\\n\\nThere\\'s 1 bathroom for girls. No stalls. If someone\\'s in there you\\'ll have to wait your turn. At least it wasn\\'t filthy & smelly.',\n",
       " u\"Can I say that the food is great?  Not really, I will say however that you don't go for the food, you go for trivia nights.  You go for the friendship.  You go for the dart boards and pool tables.  The shepard's pie is heavy but hits the spot, can't go wrong with fish and chips, the rest of it is meh.  Great place to watch World Cup when it rolls around, music is good and is good watering hole for when you feel the need to catch up with your mates.   Just don't look too closely at the carpets....\",\n",
       " u'went here a second time with my regular date \"D\" on a Friday night. \\nHe likes that place for some reason.\\n \\nI needed a drink. The female bartender gave me the beer menu and I looked at it like it was a foreign object. \"D\" said \"oh no she won\\'t drink beer, she\\'ll have some kind of mixed drink\". So the bartender made me some sweet concoction. It tasted like weak kool-aid. I ordered 2 more different drinks, even the shot of Raspberry Stoli was weak. I asked her to make me a \"British Invasion\" cocktail and that was faintly good but definitely WEAK. \"D\": said even his beer wasn\\'t good. I feel like all their drinks are super watered down.\\n\\n the drinks at George and Dragon are a BIG dissapointment, make a note of it. \\n\\nHowever we also ordered food, cause I was starving. Now THAT was good. We got the Cornish Pasty with mashed potatoes and green peas and also chicken fingers with honey mustard sauce. The cornish pasty was DELICIOUS beyond Delicious. \\n\\n Lots of people were in there and seemed to be enjoying themselves. I just don\\'t see the appeal of the place. Part of my family is from England but maybe I\\'m just not British enough to appreciate this place.\\n\\nI\\'ll probably go back for the Cornish Pasty and also cause men actually FLIRTED with me there, and that NEVER happens to me in person. I like being flirted with and whistled at.',\n",
       " u\"We were here twice. Every place (even with Guinness) can't be a 5 star place so some of the draw backs are it smells kind of funky and the parking lot really needs lines. \\n\\nBoth times I think the tap needs to be replaced because the stout was not as thick and creamy as usual. But the pubs in the UK did spoil me. The portions were a little small. We had to order seconds to feel full. \\n\\nMake sure you try the HP sauce on whatever you order. This is a thick, tangy steak sauce that makes every flavor soar. \\n\\nIt does smell a little bar-like inside.\",\n",
       " u\"This place is great. We've taken friends, out of towners, and family here. We went here the night of my bachelorette party. The food is good. I've had the hummus.. mmm I forgot what other food I had here. The service is great, there are pool tables and darts. The bathrooms are horrible, but you really go in expecting that. The big comfy booths are key. The outdoor area is really nice at night under the misters. We had one lame waitress once. She did a good enough job but had the sense of humor of a wet mop. \\n\\nThis place is always a good time.\",\n",

A shout out to the roller derby girls who were doing their own pub crawl...sorry we had to part ways.\\n\\nToo much good fun.......can't wait for the next one!!!!!\",\n",
       " u'Stopped in here on a whim and was pleasantly suprised!  This is a great bar with great food.....try the scottish egg!  The bartender sat and told me about other sites in thePhoenix area that I should go check out!  Very friendly place.  I will be returning !',\n",
       " u\"Quite good, possibly the best fish and chips I've had in the States.\",\n",
       " u\"George & Dragon! After driving by you for months, I finally decided to stop in. Very nice!\\n\\nWell, pretty nice. Maybe just nice. The four star rating is very weak, but I decided to bump up from 3 to 4 because we had a good time. I like that this place is low key and not pretentious. I like that on Sundays, they play different football games rather than just focusing on the Cardinals. And I like that they host different things, like live music and trivia nights.\\n\\nThe food is very bland. However, it's a bar, so expecting the meal of your life is a little silly. It isn't greasy, bad bar food; it's average and a little overpriced. I would stick to a simple appetizer and some drinks in the future.\\n\\nFish and chips were OK - the corn was definitely frozen, and I think the fish may have been as well. Burger was very simple and bland. I did like the thick cut fries, but they were probably frozen as well. Portions were pretty good, which is a plus.\\n\\nThe service was OK. A little lackluster - our server seemed a bit frazzled, and she was the only one working the dining room. There were several tables that hadn't been cleared of the dirty dishes after the customers had left, so seating was limited based on that. The restaurant isn't dirty, but it isn't immaculate, either.\\n\\nI can definitely see why people wouldn't like this place, but for me, it's close to home, and it's a good place to relax without being around a huge crowd. If you stop in, don't expect too much, and you'll (hopefully) be pleasantly surprised like my husband and I were.\",\n",
       " u'Good food. Staff is really nice. Erica she was a little snotty but over all a good place to be. Good vibes for the most part. They have karaoke and pool too. Cool place.',\n",
       " u\"There was a college bar near a University on the East Coast that I used to go to many years ago that always smelled like a cross between stale beer and bathroom cleaner.   I am glad those days are gone, but when I walked in the door here, that same smell (although fainter) greeted me.  Unfortunately, it's not pleasant.  I know this place is trying to be a British pub,  but it seemed more like a biker bar with the loud music, crowd and dinginess during dinner time.  It's almost like they don't give a crap about the restaurant tables.\\n\\nOur server was nice and he did a good job and my food was also decent.  The burger ordered was just okay,  but I couldn't help feeling awkward.   The dingy bar and drinking crowd in the middle of the restaurant just doesn't work for me.  \\n\\nI feel like there is so much confusion, is it a biker bar, is it a restaurant, is it a biker bar in a dingy restaurant? British pubs have more of a cozy rustic feel and this place has none of that.  \\n\\nThey could do so much for so little money to make the restaurant area just a little bit nicer or at least some cozy accent lighting so you don't feel so awkward eating here with your family.  I noticed other people felt awkward here as well.  Won't be back.\",\n",
       " u'Great food... Can not even explain the enjoyment from the Greek pizza! So delicious in my mouth! And the Guiness promo! The boyfriend got free glasses! AND for the desert... Berry cobbler... YUM! Just moved from beach area CA... So not biased! Please enjoy this place?',\n",
       " u'The first time I experienced The Eggery was for a business lunch in their back meeting room. As I walked through the restaurant, I was surprised it was so busy...I mean this IS a breakfast place, right? \\n\\nThe decor is very outdated with knick knack cutter EVERYWHERE. I am not a fan of it in my home nor in restaurants. I can see why old people love this place. \\n\\nI ordered the taco salad for my lunch. What a disappointment! Almost bad iceberg lettuce, a sprinkling of all other toppings. No beans, so if you want any protein you have to pay $2.00 extra to add chicken. This salad was not worth $8.95. With a $3 iced tea and a 20% added tip to the bill, I got out of there for $14.00. I will pay $14.00 for a weekday lunch, but only if it is a nicer place with top notch service and food. \\n\\nYesterday I went to the Eggery again with Nico and his Grandma after church. Maybe my mindset was a bit different since we were there for brunch. Same awful decor, but it seemed a bit more charming at 10:30am. \\n\\nI had the Berry Blintz Crepes which were pretty good. Stuffed inside was blueberry yogurt, mixed berries, cottage cheese, and a little bit of cream cheese. Whipped cream, toasted pecans and a berry sauce were on top of the rolled crepes. It seemed like a lot of food for $7.50, a much better value than my crappy overpriced salad. \\n\\nI am not in any hurry to return to the Eggery, although my business group meets there every week. Nico did point out that I have been here twice now and have yet to actually try any EGG dish. Maybe next time...',\n",

For years, I had passed by but was never impressed by their menu. Today I finally broke down just for the sake of being able to review them. \\nYou stand and order cafeteria style. The menu is divided into pastas, pizza, salads and sand witches. Pasta items are in the $7.50 range +$2 for chicken. Pizza is in the $6 range for two slices, a combo of one slice and a salad could be had for $7.50. Overall, the prices seemed a bit high. \\n\\nI opted for two sliced of the Bianca pizza. The crust was soft and a bit doughy, on top was mozzarella cheese, signage, ricotta and tomatoes. After I told the line what I wanted y food was hastily thrown into the oven, such haste was use my food overlapped other food, I did not appreciate this. \\n\\nI took my food to the utensil and condiment station, there was Balsamic vinegar, olive oil and red pepper but no Parmesan. \\n\\nMy slices were of normal size and the toppings had a decent flavor but the crust was subpar and at this price, I expected better. \\n\\nUnless you are stuck in this plaza, I would not recommend making the trip to this establishment.',\n",
       " u\"Well folks, I did the chain thing. I confess. Rickie and I had spent and exhausting day (and a quick $200) at Target and were thinking steaks. The budget didn't include Morton's or Ruth's Chris. I had brain freeze and forgot the local spots I love so much that grill a mean meat (i.e. Phoenix City Grill), so the first restaurant past Target that fit the bill was our local Applebee's on Camelback and Central. Mind you, I don't expect a decor marvel or a hostess so hip it hurts. I know what i'm getting myself into. For the most part. But I had recently seen a TV commercial from Applebee's and of course the food was airbrushed so perfectly like Celine Dion's face on the current issue of HELLO magazine. I mean, really, Celine, you have no wrinkles even after living in Las Vegas these past couple of years? Anyhoo, we were greeted and seeted promptly by a teenager who definitley just had a smoke and could use a visit to the tanning booth. Once seated, our server, Mo, took our drink and appetizer order and quickly disappeared. For quite awhile. Cue the Jeoporady theme music. Once our iced teas and the new appetizer (tuscan cheese bread extravangza) arrived we sipped and dipped. Not bad.Raspberry tea with an univited yet delighted visit by vanilla and the cheese spread was rich and yummy served with a spot of diced tomato, basi and garlic...aka bruscetta. NICE. We ordered onion chips, like an onion loaf or the blooming onion at Outback....they were good. Two sauces for our dipping pleasure...one your typical ranch, the other a sort of spiced up thousand island with horseradish. Then the entrees arrived. Cue the creepy dum, dum, dum, music...Both NY strip steaks over cooked to such an extreme. The asparagus was limp like, well, let's just say it reminded me of a Vietmanese gymnast I once dated who didn't take the little blue pill. Sides included mashed potatoes (loaded) which means bacon, cheese and sour cream. Ok, Ok, Ok, too much of the extras. What ladle in the kitchen did they pick to put these extras on my mashed potatoes? All in all, I had low expectations at this venue, and they were met. Shout out to Mo the server, a good gal! The clientele was like a scene out of Dawn of the Dead. Sorry. Lesson learned...Applebee's ok some of the time. Get an app and a drink. Skip the entrees. Be nice to a nice server. And for God's sake don't expect a steak worthy of the big chain peeps.\",\n",

We were idiots.\\n\\ncNstuff has been around forever and is owned by the nicest family on the planet. The minute I walk in there the smell of cheese (or is it sandwiches?) makes me instantly hungry. And there is lots of cheese. \\n\\nThe sandwich menu is extensive and I always have the hardest time deciding what to order. It seems like there is a new sandwich added everyday. Do I want the Doe Boy or just a plain ol' Tuna? Russian dressing or mustard? Sub roll or wheat? For extra you can get a side of chips, potato or macaroni salad (which is a little too sweet for me). There is also a plethora of little extra snacks to fill up on, candy bars, twinkies you name it. Last time in there, there was noticeably less Swedish products on the shelves which was a little sad. Maybe they weren't selling very well? They were always enjoyable to look at. \\n\\nAnyway, please stop in to this delightful little sandwich shop, you won't be disappointed.\\n\\nEdited to add: German products, not Swedish. They were Umlaut-laden names so I got confused.\",\n",
       " u\"I just re-visited Cheese 'N Stuff this weekend after a while.  I guess just eat during their limited hours very often.  They close very early (4pm).\\n\\nI love their liverwurst sandwiches and the Bismark but this time I decided to try the Doughboy people speak of minus mayo as I do not enjoy warm sandwich lubrication.  As ever the place is tiny, homey and spotlessly clean.  I had some of the hot German Potato salad as a side and a ginger ale.   All were yummy, delicious and satisfying! \\n\\n As I was eating I had a yen for a Celery Soda to go with this classic sandwich but I've only been able to get them at Chompie's in the valley.  There are loads of interesting European cookies to get packages of as dessert so grab a couple of friends when you go but carpool as the lot is smallish.  I guess they stopped giving pickles with sandwiches, bummer.\",\n",
       " u\"I love the Blazin Chicken!  Sandwich's are always fresh and tasty!\",\n",
       " u\"Had my first visit on Saturday and already have my next order ready! I had the sliced pork loin on marble rye. So many of Downtown's one of a kind places are closed on Saturday, so this will for sure become a regular place for lunch.\",\n",
       " u\"You can drive by this place forever and not know they have the best sandwiches in Phoenix!!  All of the ingredients are super fresh.  Biting in the bread is like biting into a little heaven cloud.  So soft and delicious it's almost not fair that other places have to compete.  I'm not a big fan of deli sides (potato salad, macaroni salad) but the ol lady says the macaroni salad is some of the best she's ever had.  The menu is a little hard to see as it is scattered but have no fear, if you don't find one you like, they'll make you one however you want it.  Family run and the owners are very nice.\",\n",
       " u\"Cute little family owned sandwich shop in uptown. \\nGreat meats and (duh) cheeses. \\nGood selection of specialty sandwiches, with printed descriptions randomly taped all over the walls. \\nTypical of this kind of place, it's a little slow and prices are higher. \\nGreat location, I'm putting it on my regular rotation.\",\n",
       " u\"I always hear hype about China Chili...now I've been there a few times and it is decent but nothing to rave about.  Unfortunately I never made it there prior to the big move but I really cannot imagine that much changed in the way of food greatness.  My vote still goes to GHoHK.\",\n",
       " u'So my first experience here was not so hot. The dishes we ordered were pretty bland (all needed a generous amount of soy sauce). The one thing I did enjoy were the pot-stickers and the yummy dipping sauce. I ended up pouring that pure yummyness all over my main entree. To tell you the truth, I was hesitant on trying this place again until I took a peek at some reviews and found people had lots of good things to say about the place.\\n\\nSo i gave it another shot. The atmosphere in this place is like sitting in large asian shoe box, it\\'s one big dining room, yet it\\'s not off-putting. It\\'s strangely welcoming. You feel like your family with everyone else eating there. I went on a Saturday night and I was surprised to see so many old people. I\\'m all \"this place has to be good if the older crowd is here\". The  psychedelic plastic lighting fixtures cycling through all the colors of the rainbow makes me laugh but I love it. The service is quick and attentive, however when we tried to order a Mountain Dew and Dr. Pepper, the small asian woman had no idea what we were talking about and blurted out something I could not make out. I heard \"Coke\" in the jumble of words and just said \"yes\". They work as a team there which makes for some speedy service. We ordered a few appetizers: Pot-Stickers and Crab  Puffs. The Pot Stickers were good but the Crab Puffs were not. The inside lacked any crab at all and had a runny constancy that quite frankly, surprised me. Eww. Avoid these. I remember reading a review from Alexander C. suggesting the Orange Chicken. What a great choice! The dish made up for the runny crab puffs. The meat was top notch; moist with no grizzly chunks like a lot of places have. The sauce was bursting with flavor and had just the right amount of heat to it. I highly recommend this dish.\\n\\nChina Chili...glad I gave it another shot :)',\n",
       " u\"I had an instant craving for some Chinese take-out and fortunately there were 15 minuets left before closing so I hit China Chili on the speed dial. I ordered the House Chow Mien which was ready just as I walked through the door. I could feel my food still sizzling through the Styrofoam to-go container. I couldn't get home fast enough and the smell from the back seat was so tempting I was close to pulling off to the side of the road and diving in. So I get home rip open the plastic bag to find my noddles steaming and filled with shrimp, pork, chicken, and scallions. This was one delicious meal (way better than Pei Wei) and the portion was huge for just under $9 bucks. I stuffed my face crazy and sill have enough for left overs or until I get hungry again in the next hour or so.\",\n",
       " u\"This is a great restaurant if you're a fan of Chinese food.  I seem to gravitate around the spicey dishes, like chicken and beef.  On their menu, the spicey dishes have a little red chili pepper next to the dish.  Their soups are very good, too.  I tend to go there for lunch because I work near the state capitol, so I'm not sure what the menu looks like at dinner time.  The prices are very reasonalbe, but if you do go there for lunch, go early!!  The place really fills up, and there is not much off-street parking.  After noon time, there are always people waiting to be seated.\\n\\nYears ago, this restaurant was located on Central Avenue in a little, tiny brick building painted bright pink in color.  They lost their lease in that former location, and the building was torn down, so they didn't exist for about a year and a half.  Finally, they reopened at their current location at 3rd Street and Flower.  I'm glad they returned!!\",\n",
       " u'The food here is really good!  The interior of the restaurant however leaves a lot to be desired, it is very mauve & green. It is your typical Chinese food restaurant, and the servers are not overly friendly. They do however, provide prompt service. This is still the best Chinese food I have had in Phoenix that does not belong to a chain.',\n",
       " u'There is really one reason that I go to China Chili all the time...The boiled wontons.  The rest of the food is pretty typical chinese fare.  Best to take a group of friends and mix and match dishes. \\n\\nOur favorite dishes here, besides the boiled won tons, are the spicy eggplant and the green beans and tofu.  We order them extra spicy to kick it up a notch. Even extra spicy and Dan will load up both the boiled won tons and the dishes with the hot sauce at the table.  In fact we usually leave the hot sauce jar empty by the time we leave the restaurant.  \\n\\nParking is a bit hard to find on busy nights there and I usually end up parking on the street.  \\n\\nThe portions are gigantic and I always have take away dishes for the next day.\\n\\nPrices are reasonable.  If you do order the soup realize you can order it and share for the table.',\n",
       " u\"So we'd been here before, and it's been quite some time. We decided to go back tonight because I was REALLLLLY craving some Asian noodles. We got the Singapore rice noodles with chicken, shrimp, egg, onion and curry. We also went with my fave chinese appetizer (if done right) BBQ beef. The BBQ beef here is great, very close to what I'd get at home (By home, I mean Seattle..best Asian food in the US). The noodle dish was pretty good too. it's exactly like this one dish that wifey and I used to get at Big Wong's (when they were open) called Hamun Rice Noodles. We have been searching for a comparable dish, and alas we've found it. Overall the food was good, and came with plenty (plus I have a before-I-go-to-class-tomorrow-evening snack. Excited to go back again to try some other stuff on the ginormous menu (that's a huge Bit**)\",\n",
       " u'Get the Salt and Pepper Chicken!',\n",
       " u\"Great Food very tasty and some unique dishes I'd never seen before like Pillow Chicken!  Large portions and nice presentation on plate.  Open cafeteria style dining room.  Prompt waitresses and waiters...\",\n",
       " u'I have been here a couple of times but I never reviewd it...it is good Chinese!  It is located on 3rd st just south of indian school rd.  It is a huge restaurant...in fact I do not think I have ever been in an authentic Chinese restaurant that is that large in my life...lol...there is plenty of parking on the side and back of the property.  You walk  in you are greeted by the hostess and they will take you to one of the many many tables...this place is always busy because it is very popular.  The servers are on it...they are used to getting people in and out fast because as soon as you sit down they are asking what you would like...didnt bother me because I like to get my food!  hahaha...they have great lunch specials for no more then seven to ten dollars...i like the kung pao shrimp...lots of veggies and the spice is pretty good...the house chicken is good and I enjoyed the mongolian beef when I had it too!  Once you order your food you will get it in like 5 minutes.  It is good food!  I enjoy it and I will be back!',\n",
       " u'Yeah not so bad Chinese food, big portions, family style.  The service, does not go out of their way but does their job very well.  \\nThis would be a classic 3 and a half stars.  \\nI like plates that come out sizzling from the heat.  This is a nice place to have a larger group sit down and eat family style.\\n\\nLook for their sign off 3rd st.',\n",
       " u'He a group of six, all we very happy. We all ordered different items and appetizers and had to bring home food. Portions are large and service was great.',\n",
       " u\"Food is typical of Phoenix Chinese food, very boring. After everything I'd heard of the place, I was expecting alot more.  Was hoping for  along the lines of San Fran, or NYC, , but no such luck. Will not be back. I agree that portions were big and food was delivered fast, but doesn't make a difference if the food isn't good.\",\n",
       " u'Food exceeded expectations. Waitress was quietly attentive. We are discerning Chinese diners and will definitely come back.  Spicy Hunan Tofu very nice!',\n",
       " u\"We went this past Saturday with my sister-in-law and her husband.  She works in the area and suggested we go to dinner here. \\n\\nI was extremely pleased with our meal.  We started with Egg Rolls, Pot Stickers and Boiled Won Tons.  The egg rolls were crispy and flavorful, the pot stickers were plump and the filling was delish, but the star for me was the boiled won tons.  I have never had anything like them, They were packed full of meat and served in this savory peanut flavored broth. My sister-in-law was a little wary of trying one, but she did and concurred that they were quite good.  She is not the most adventurous eater so that is really saying something!\\n\\nFor our main courses we  shared Mongolian Beef, Peking Shrimp, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, and Sichuan Beef.  The Mongolian Beef was tender and seasoned perfectly, The Peking Shrimp had a spicy red sauce the had a little tang to is and was served with snow peas (nice and crunchy not over cooked) and onions.  The salt and pepper shrimp were fried with a nice light batter that was salty but not over done and the jalapeno peppers were just right.  The Sichuan  Beef was my least favorite, I thought the sauce made the batter a little soggy but I really liked that sauce so was still a good dish.\\n\\nThe portions are huge, I was full after the appetizers as were my dinner companions, so we took a lot of our dinner home, and it tasted great the next day.  Our waitress was very sweet and attentive.  I especially appreciated that she boxed up our leftovers instead of just dropping off some boxes at the table.\\n\\nFrom the outside the restaurant doesn't really look like much, a sand colored stucco building, but inside it is furnished and decorated nicely, the tables are spaced  so that you don't feel crowded and the lighting was bright but not overly so.\\n\\nMy only complaint would be that their tofu dishes had meat in them so there weren't as many vegetarian options as I would have like to have seen.  I didn't get a chance to ask if they can adjust them for vegetarians, but will the next time I go and before I take any of my veggie buddies there.\",\n",
       " u\"Seriously, people giving this place high reviews? When we went here last, the chicken was dry and had a burnt coating that slid right off. And it was somewhat temperate in the middle, confirming my suspicion that this was made earlier and then just re-fried, cut, and served. I don't think any restaurant should get any stars when they just open a can or packet (yes, I'm talking about the vegetables and sauces) and mix with pre-cooked meat. That IS NOT good Chinese food. As someone who has lived where there are actual Chinatowns (Boston and San Francisco), I know what very good Chinese food is, and this place certainly is not.\\n\\nOh, and the lighting. Who said that bright, overhead lighting creates a pleasant atmosphere for dining? \\n\\nI have yet to find a Chinese restaurant here in the Phoenix area that actually puts together fresh ingredients from scratch. If anyone knows of one, please let me know.\",\n",
       " u\"I'm not surprised to see the wide variance in the ratings for China Chili, to be fair they tend to be incomsistent. It has been a staple for us going back 15 years to their location on Central. We have visitors from SF, Vancouver, NY, LA who are consistently amazed to find Chinese food of this quality in Phoenix. Even if they are the best of Phoenix on a good day, they are not rivals for the 5 stars in those towns though. \\nHere's a few tips for getting the most out of China Chile. Don't do take out. Always get a soup, hot n sour is our favorite. Chicken Salad is special. They never miss on spring rolls and pot stickers. Honey walnut prawns get my luv one Jonesing to go there. Orange chicken and orange beef have not disappointed. Noodles have. Chow fun or chow mein should be on your order. They do shell fish superbly, especially scallops. Whole fish is a mixed bag some great, some not so. The pork chops and chashu are a bit dry for my taste. Special menus on the whole have been disappointing. It's boom or bust, but if they offer seared beef tenderloin take the risk. One night I'm raving to fiends about how good it is, at the same time a guy at an adjacent table is complaining to the manager about the very same dish. That's China Chile.\",\n",
       " u\"Took my daughters here, so the adventures were already going to be limited.\\nOrdered the pot stickers, which were delicious.\\n\\nWe ordered beef, chicken, and pork chow mein, and shared it amongst us.\\n\\nThe dishes were large, and delicious.\\n\\nThe spicy relish they provide on the table is amazing.\\n\\nI have been wanting to go here, and I'm glad I did. I will probably be back.\",\n",
       " u\"I love this place! Wish my work was still close to it because I'd eat there at least once a week for lunch.  Their lunch specials are so inexpensive!  We're talking $5-$6 a plate which includes the entree, rice and a cup of soup.  Can't get better than that.  Their service during lunch is amazingly fast.  That way if you only have an hour for lunch, you're in and out with time to spare. \\n\\nMy most recent review is when 14 of my friends and I went to China Chili for dinner.  We actually planned on going to Gallo Blanco but it was almost a 2 hour wait to accommodate our party.  So off to China Chili we went and there was no wait to boot!  We ordered the peking duck, mongolian beef, house chow mein, fried rice, walnut shrimp, peking pork chops, crispy noodles, ma po tofu...and really, that's all I can remember.  Some of the guys also had beers and sake.  I can't think of one dish that I did not like.  This place does NOT disappoint.  After stuffing our faces, we were delighted that our bill, plus tax and gratuity ended up being $10 a person.  What a deal!!!\\n\\nI am a huge fan of China Chili!\",\n",
       " u\"Go there for lunch about twice a week.  Portions are great and the service is very good too.  Their food is also very good and different in some cases where I've been pleasantly surprised.  Will continue going there and will recommend.\",\n",
       " u'China Chili is great when you want good food FAST.  I don\\'t know how they get their food out so quickly, but it\\'s pretty awesome - especially when you only have an hour lunch break.  I came here for lunch with my co-workers during the lunch rush and we all got our food within ten minutes of ordering.  I also came and ordered to-go after work one day and my food was also ready within ten minutes.\\n\\nOn top of being fast, the quality is there too.  I ordered the seafood blossom soup and it had nice chunks of shrimp and scallop in it and wasn\\'t just all broth.  I also ordered the mapo tofu, which I really liked.  I can\\'t say that its truly \"authentic\" Chinese food, but it\\'s really tasty and I\\'ll definitely be back!',\n",
       " u\"Very good food. Don't like their sweet and sour sauce or their pillow chicken but they can sure pull off a mean sesame chicken and those boiled won tons are to die for! \\n\\nI haven't gotten to test out their duck yet but their food has me wow'd compared to some of the crap I've gotten from other Asian restaurants near the area!\\n\\nDefinitely give this place a try and more than once because not everyone likes the same things, but you will find a dish you like on their menu, believe that!\",\n",
       " u\"I'm with Norma on the to-go option at Sweet Tomatoes.  I stopped by after Yelp Office Hours today and picked up a salad to go.  (I had planned on eating at Pane Bianco but they are closed on Monday - bummer!)  Actually, for $8.22, it was a great deal!  I left with a huge salad, a side of steamed veggies, a cup of soup, a sweet potato, and an apple.  Now that is getting a bang for your buck!\\n\\nI've also eaten at other locations in the past and left feeling way too full because when you eat there, you have to take advantage of everything including the fro yo, bakery items, and more... \\n\\nI was impressed that the entire salad bar was kept clean and had many options to choose from.  I noticed for an additional fee, you can also get a side of grilled chicken now.  I didn't need that though with so many other options.  \\n\\nI will not be a regular at Sweet Tomatoes, anytime soon, but for the right occasion, especially when picking up 'to-go' lunch, it works.  Good thing I didn't read the other reviews on this location before I went, or I probably would've spent double the $$ at AJ's around the corner!\",\n",

       " u\"I am normally not one for buffets, but Sweet Tomatoes came highly recommended by some family members for a healthy place to go have some soup and salad quickly.  We stopped in one night and really liked it.  The homemade soup selection was plentiful and made it hard to decide which one to try.  The salad bar was huge, fresh and a really nice selection of veggies.  There were many options of pizza, pasta, breads and desserts too.  You certainly shouldn't leave this place hungry!\",\n",

When I ordered the Relleno my waitress raved about how good they were, and from the first bite I understood her enthusiasm - I wished I had ordered 2 more!

       " u\"This place is OK. Pizza is decent. Usually takes a bit longer to get then I expect. Service is usually pretty good. \\n\\nNothing special about this place. It does have a loyal following though. I don't know why. Is it the grossly over sized menus? The old swing/big band era music playing in the background? The pizzookie? I dunno. \\n\\nI'd be more tempting in returning here during non-peak hours, because when this place is slamming, there is a long wait at door to sit and a longer wait to get the food.\",\n",
       " u'3.5 stars\\n\\nI am afraid my review is going to sound a bit repetitious of previous yelps, but I figured I should add my two cents. \\n\\nI love Oreganos. When I was attending college in Tucson, Oreganos was just opening up. In fact my roommate and I attended a group interview in an attempt to snag a job, but unfortunately they did not find our request to wear diner outfits and call ourselves Dot and Myrtle amusing. Perhaps we were just too excited to serve pizza. \\n\\nI enjoy the pizza (I am not above thin crust), pasta, and atmosphere- in fact it is my in laws favorite place to go when they are in town. The pesto pasta with chicken added is my go to on the menu. The chicken is thin, almost shaved, strips and they absorb all the yummy pesto goodness. The one thing that keeps me from making the drive to Oreganos more often is the wait. No reservations, first come first served type of place and despite them having plenty of seating options, and on occasions open tables, I never seem to get out of there with less than a 30-45 minute wait. Regardless of the time of day, day of week, season, etc. there is always a wait. Once you get past the wait for the table, then you wait a little more for your server, then your food and when it is all said and done my dinner has stretched out to 1 1/2 -3 hours (depending on how many of us) and sometimes there is not enough goodness on a plate that can make up for that amount of time for pizza. \\n\\nWhile some people complain that it is a chain, it is a local start chain, which keeps it out of the axis of evil for me. I will continue to return to Oreganos on occasion, when I have absolutely no plans to follow my meal.',\n",
       " u'Probably one of the best chain restaurants. Very casual, great atmosphere and nice patio. The servery brought a small plate with some bread dough to play with while we ordered and waited for the food. We had the Guaca Tony as appetizer, which was delicious. If you like good wings, try the Italian Gold Wings. They are awesome!!! When we went there it was extremely busy and it took a while to get the food. I was a little upsetting in the beginning, but the manager came to the table and offered us a complimentary dessert. The original pizza cookie.',\n",
       " u\"I've been here probably 8-10 times over the past 5 or 6 years. \\n\\nConsistent: \\n- The wait. Doesn't matter if it's lunch or dinner, the wait is ridiculous. On the positive side, the reception desk kept the cups of iced water coming. \\n- The food is always good, which probably explains the wait. I strayed from my carmelized onion, gorgonzola pizza to try their spinach salad. Not a single regret - it was super tasty! \\n- That damn pizookie. Even if the food in general sucked, I'd come here just for the pizookie... mmmmmm. \\n\\nIf you haven't been... you should go!\",\n",
       " u\"I used to go here all the time for lunch to get their mini deep dish pizzas that are limited in supply and you better get there early because they go quick...because they are sooo good and they can feed two people almost.  But went there with the family last night and  you know how it can be kinda difficult to satisfy 4 people with the same pizza?  So we often do half and half to make everybody happy...and we've never ran into this situation, they wanted to charge as if the whole pizza had all the toppings...meaning if you get 3 toppings on one side and 3 different toppings on the other side, you better be prepared to pay for a 6 topping pizza...about $8 extra.  So they are off the 'family friendly' list for me.\",\n",
       " u'This place is mackin, friendly service with authentic food. We had the chicken wings as an app which tasted good, but nothing to write home about. I had the Italian Flag Lasagna which took about 40 minutes but was definitely worth the wait, some of the best I have had in a longtime. This dish was made from scratch, you can taste the difference with fresh backed pasta, good sauce and lots of meat. My wife had the Grilled Italian Sausage Sandwich. You can tell the sausage was made in house with great spices and a little bit of heat. We will definitely go back.',\n",
       " u\"I am a NY pizza guy but as far as Pizza goes in Phoenix this place is the best!  You need to get the Fried Raviolis and the Wings are good too! They even offer Good Blue Cheese which is the right way to eat wings (sorry all of you West Coasters but Ranch isn't the original)\",\n",
       " u\"Good food, pass on the staff attitude.  We ordered the Chicago stuffed pizza on Sunday evening.  The waiter pushed us to order an appetizer or salad and this was after we asked for suggestions on the 10 or 12 inches.  After suggesting what size he thought I could handle, even though there was two of us at the table, we went with the ten.  Apparently I can handle ten with no problem?  Not sure what he was referring to on the size, it seemed like a pointed comment with innuendo towards myself.  He told us it would be 40-45 minutes.  After a nice conversation, with my friend at the table, we asked on the time as it seemed like it had been at least 45 minutes.  When we asked the waiter then quoted I stated it would be up to an hour.  Hmm, 15 minute grace period?  My friend being a Taurus, fired at him to check on the status.  He then came out and told me it was almost ready.  He then brought it out and quoted the time it took 49 minutes.  Food was great, I learned a lesson in time and apparently sizes.  I'm hoping he was not a representation of the staff as I'll pass on that.\",\n",
       " u'Oregano\\'s tried to kill me by putting me in a food coma.\\n\\nYes, the value is off the charts. The amount of food you get for the price is ridiculous. You can easily make one meal stretch into three or four. And it all tastes good.\\n\\nThe service really irked me though. \\n\\nI had  never eaten at an Oregano\\'s before, so I didn\\'t really know the deal, but apparently everything on the menu (except salads) takes approximately 35-55 minutes to cook. Uh, seriously? \\n\\nOur lunch (six women and 1 baby) took over TWO HOURS!? That\\'s just insane. \\n\\nWhen someone would order something our server would say \"You DO know that takes about 45 minutes, right?\" uh... No actually I didn\\'t. Thanks for making me look like an idiot though.\\n\\nWe had appetizers, then salad, then pizza and entrees. We mostly shared everything because of the portions and time to cook, but the server never offered to clear our steady growth of dirty plates, and when we asked him to clear them, he didn\\'t bring new plates or silverware. \\n\\nAnd when he did finally clear some things, he held the plates over the baby\\'s head... I mean Jesus Christ, have some awareness! \\n\\nYeah the food was good, but is it worth the time or the crazy amount of calories? No.',\n",
       " u'I gave this place a second try because i figured maybe we got all the wrong stuff the first time. Also because my friends are always raving about this place. So we went back to try the deep dish and waited over 45 minutes for a table (what a waste) and after ordering and praying it was gonna be as amazing as everyone says it is, it was....\\n\\nDUSGUSTING!! I barely finished one slice. This place is SO OVERRATED. I think food out of a garbage  just might taste better. All I know is if I had the option to eat at this place or the gargage, garbage would be my solid number one choice.',\n",
       " u'I visited here last Sunday afternoon with my ex-husband.  We ordered a Pan Crust  pizza and were told it would take 45 minutes to an hour.  I was pretty hungry so I also ordered the Shrimp Caesar Salad, that I got a glimpse of as a waiter carried one past us, to nibble on during the long wait for pizza.  \\n\\nThe salad was ok....mostly lettuce and dressing.  There were about a dozen nicely seasoned shrimp on it but certainly not enough for size or the cost of the salad.  \\n\\nThe pizza was ok too, but it was NOT worth waiting 45 minutes for...nor was the whole meal worth $50.00+ for one 12\" pizza, one salad and one iced tea!',\n",
       " u\"To be able to say that everything you've ever eaten at a restaurant has been fantastic is quite a statement, however I can honestly say that about Oregano's. I fell in love with this place from the first time I ate there and I've never looked back. I've tried a lot of pizza in my 27 years here as a Phoenix native, and this place probably has the best pizza in town. The Italian Gold wings are to die for, the kick butt garlic bread is unlike any garlic bread you'll find anywhere else, and the drinks and desserts are both unique and fantastic. Add a friendly, upbeat wait staff to these things, and you have a dining experience that will keep you coming back. Be prepared to wait, especially on Friday or Saturday evenings, because it is a popular place. However, it will be worth the wait, every single time.\",\n",
       " u\"Recently we had a take-out of Oregano's pasta Basta and Southwestern shrimp Cesar salad. I'm going to have to say this salad in particular was not my favorite. The pasta dish did not fully satisfy only because adding protein to the dish was disappointing. FYI adding meatballs to your dish means ONE meatball to your dish for $3.50. I repeat- just one. \\n\\nBut, not to be discouraged! Pizza here is always comforting! :)\",\n",
       " u'An Italian chain loved by most of Phoenix, but overhyped.\\n\\nIn my experience, the wait for a table is usually an hour or close to it. A cost far too high for the dining experience that is to ensue. Once seated the restaurant has a very interesting theme. It seems like there is a lot of work put into gathering all of the wall decorations. The decorations remind me of something I would expect to see at a TGIF or a Buca di Beppo, another Italian chain.\\n\\nThe appetizers we enjoyed all were very good. I would recommend the bruschetta, cheesy bread, and wings. The service on getting us our drinks was very slow and the beer was not very good. The pizza itself was better than most pizza I have here in the valley.',\n",
       " u\"I love Oreganos! I work here and I know it may seem clich\\xe9 to say I love everything about this place but I honestly do! My coworkers are the best, the food is DELICIOUS and the environment is uplifting and fun. I LOVE Oreganos and if you're a little iffy about trying it, I promise you will love it :)\",\n",
       " u'This location is pretty friendly over all. \\nI walk over here when I get hungry during long days in the studio as its right around the corner. Yay for tacos and cheesy fries.',\n",
       " u\"This review was really tough for me because everything about this place sucks except for one sandwich.\\n\\nAnd here's the thing about that.\\n\\nTHIS SANDWICH IS LIKE JESUS.\\n\\nIt could be the most amazing thing I've ever tasted. I crave it fortnightly, no joke. \\n\\nDon't try the pizza and stay awaaaaaaay from the calzones. Try the Bronx Bomber. I swear to god you will probably scream some incredibly inappropriate exaltation after your first bite, that is, if you don't just lose all faculties and crap your pants right there in the shop.\\n\\nYeah, I'm pretty crazy about it.\",\n",
       " u'Service is not why you should visit this joint.\\nFood is why! Their subs are tasty and delicious. The wait is not so fun.. \\nHowever the fresh food is what makes me keep coming back..\\n\\nI have brought these suns to many who dont keep kosher and they continuously ask me to bring it again! \\nI take into consideration their slow service by ordering in advance. Thats what you got to do to enjoy the great food here...',\n",
       " u\"This place gets THREE-STARS just for being Kosher and it's just alright.  I ordered a veggie calzone here and there isn't really much to say about it.  Nothing spectacular.  The parking lot is very bizarre.  It's definitely worth a shot!  Maybe I'll get something else here next time.\",\n",
       " u\"Great place for a business lunch!  Quiet conversation.  Good food.  Attentive [but not intrusive] service.  Reasonable prices.\\n\\nI'm beginning to salivate again!\",\n",
       " u'Wow, really this place is as legit as Hammer in the 90\\'s.  This is a place where I take my parents when they say take us to a nice place.  This is also a place where  I would take a date and dump her if she did not like the food.  I did not venture into the Italian side of the menu but will definitely be coming back as much as possible.  \\nMy Plate\\nI normally don\\'t write about what I ate but this place is an exception.  I had the tempera plate and it blew my mind away.  Large shrimp fish good veggies and Crab, What this place out did themselves.  The rice is right on and I\\'m a picky rich eater. And I won\\'t leave out the blue berry banana bread, another nice touch.\\nSo why not Five Stars,\\nWell the service was not crazy five star worthy but was not terrible.  \\nOk I\"m sure the more I eat here the more likely it will earn the fifth star, because I have craved the place every night since I first tried it.',\n",
       " u'I\\'m thinking that the normal staff was off yesterday. \\n\\nI went to Cherry Blossom with very high hopes thanks all the positive yelp reports and was very disappointed. This onetime experience won\\'t stop me from coming back to give the Cafe another chance...as I think I might have been transported to a parallel universe for this meal. \\n\\nFirst off... cute little place, there is no doubt that this is not a chain. The interior of the restaurant is simple and looks more like your dining at an authentic Asian bistro in Vancouver rather then in a central Phoenix strip mall. Our server was a little slow getting to us, again, this is not a chain, so that was overlooked. \\n\\nI ordered a Summer Roll (per menu - Shrimp, lettuce, avocado, cucumber and rice noodles) and a Shrimp tempera roll. When the orders arrived the summer roll looked great, but was stuffed with a \"bonus\" of that weird crab lookalike stuff made from fish heads and fins.. YUK! Not a problem, I\\'ll just scoop it out onto the appetizer plate... \\n\\nso when I counted, the Summer roll with shrimp, did have shrimp.. 2 of them, and I kid you not, 1/2 cup of that crab stuff. \\n\\nWhen my \"shrimp\" tempura roll arrived, guess what?? its a fake crab tempura roll with one shrimp... lol... The rice...VERY sticky... By the time the meal was over, my app plate was mounded with about a cup of this crab scented stuff... such a waste... \\n\\nMy friend\\'s pasta ( Marsala Chicken) was great... the chicken was all breast meat, with a really good Marsala sauce...it was impressive! ... So overall... weird experience... will it keep me away??... no, well not unless it happens again...\\n\\nThe strangest thing about this whole ordeal is the fact  the main ingredient of my appetizer and sushi roll was not even on the menu.',\n",
       " u\"Craving a noodle soup--thought I'd check this place after seeing the reviews.  Upon entering I didn't like the air quality, smelled like dirty deep frying oil.  Upon perusing the menu and looking around at other diners food, I realized it was mostly composed of tempura, duh, deep fried.  Yikes, I am not a fan of deep frying but that explained the smell.   I opted for the shrimp udon soup.  It wasn't anything near the wonderful soup I had experienced elsewhere, especially this great Japanese restaurant in Chiang Mai that had this amazing moat around the sushi chefs were they would float the sushi on little boats that you could pick and choose.  Very disappointing, broth, noodles, spinach, green onion and 2 shrimp, $8.  I did get an added bonus of deep fat smell covering my clothing.\",\n",
       " u\"Wish I can go back here...\\n\\nTheir menu as other yelpers have suggested is extensive. I was a bit weary about having non-Japanese food so stuck to good 'ol chicken katsu. For 10 bucks, you get miso soup, all white meat chicken perfectly fried (light and not greasy), and a side salad. Oh yeah, the bread basket with slices of banana bread, dinner roll, and cinnamon sugared crostinis were soooo delish! I was actually full by the time my meal arrived but didn't want to be rude and begrudgingly ate my meal (in perfect bliss). I went at 11:30 and was out by 12:30 without feeling rushed or not attended to. My waitress told me to take the bill to the cashier if I was in a hurry.\\n\\nI was very happy with my meal and service and would love to go back for some Italian grub...will have to convince boss to send me to Phoenix again :)\",\n",
       " u\"I usually like to try new places but I crave the Champon soup at this place. Yes, I've tried the other dishes but I always order the same thing. it's fantastic on a cold night or any night for that matter.  It is too big to finish and is packed with seafood, noodles, and a savory broth. Try it if you like seafood. The calamari (fried) and the steamed clams are also delicious.\",\n",
       " u\"I've been here twice now. Initially, I was impressed at the management of a huge table (we had like 20 people) and the waitress had no problem doing separate checks and was quick upon return with the checks and change.  Yet when I went with just another person, although crowded, the service was not that great. \\n\\nThe one thing that was odd - some food came out fairly quickly, yet others' orders took forever.  Some of my friends waited about 20 minutes after everyone else received their dishes, and it's not like they ordered something totally different. In fact, some of the orders were identical to the other friends. Then again, we did have 20 people.  During the time I was just with another person, it was a similar thing - my food came out way earlier than my friend's. \\n\\nI ordered the summer rolls that were quite tasty, and the prices were very reasonable. I ordered miso soup and edamame which were both delicious. My mom ordered the pad Thai and loved it. I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of food one could order for a decent price.  \\n\\nThe parking could likely get to be a problem. I managed to find a spot, but during busier hours with the other surrounding businesses, I imagine it would be messy.  Also, the only other negative thing was that my mojito was really not that tasty.\",\n",
       " u\"Local and cute setting in central Phoenix.  Love the Hakata soup, basically Ramen noodles, but inexpensive for a bowl of warm yumminess!  It can be pretty loud at times, if full, but that's ok, I've been in much worse.  It's very Japanese with a twist for those who are unfamiliar with Japanese foods, you can always order an Italian dish instead.  Sushi is good, and reasonable in price as well.  The cooks are insight and friendly with those sitting at the bar.  You know it's pretty authentic when you see more Japanese/Asian sitting and eating their bowl of soup, many choices to choose from too!\",\n",
       " u'This place was discovered purely by accident.  I wanted some noodle dish and i was near my old high school I googled good noodle places on my phone...this place.came up...i was like why not just try it for take out...i pulled up and i walked in and looked at the menu...i was so confused...tbey have italian and asian choices...i was like great this place cannot be too good if they are offering two types of food...but i was there already so i was going to try it...i was conflicted i love italian but i wanted asian so i got a staple...pad thai...it was delicious...full of flavor and i was very impressed! Since then i have been back and this place is good...i go here if i am in the area...its super casual...i love to take the food home and eat if while watching my reality tv and desperate housewives show...good place you should try it!',\n",
       " u\"I first came to this restaurant with my dad and his wife a few years ago. She is from Japan and my dad works with a lot of Japanese executives and they both said that whenever friends come from Japan, this is where they go. Cherry Blossom is a very different and authentic restaurant. If you haven't tried it I definitely reccommend it. I have had noodles before and most recently tried the curry and both were great. My husband had the pad thai and enjoyed it as well. They also have some italian noodle dishes if you have picky eaters with you!\",\n",

When we went to this place, I was excited about digging my chopsticks into a nice bowl of ramen but what we got instead was anticlimactic.  Sigh... so much potential but it fell a little short.   \\n\\nHaving said that, it tasted ok.  I can see myself coming back since it will definitely satisfy my cravings until my next visit back to LA but unfortunately,  it won't be one of the top places on my list.\",\n",

       " u'Weird...\\n\\nI expected this to be a Japanese restaurant and had been wanting to try it. I\\'ve driven past a million times and kept thinking to try noodles. So I walked in and BAM! Italian decor? WTH was going on.\\n\\nThis restaurant has zero sense of identity, but decent food.\\n\\nThey don\\'t really know what a vegetarian is, in spite of actually having some decent adaptable vegetarian entrees. We asked our waitress and she said, \"WELL WE HAVE SALADS!\" -_- \\n\\nThey need to educate the staff on the menu for situations like these, whether the person is gluten-free, vegan, or vegetarian. So, I managed to work with Miss Clueless, and customized the pad thai - it was delicious! \\n\\nHonestly, I probably won\\'t be going back. I could definitely find better Thai dishes, and can buy many of the noodles myself. It wasn\\'t bad, just wasn\\'t special.',\n",
       " u\"3.5 stars, but I've rounded up.  I've been coming here for years...and I keep coming back.  Its known for the noodles and I'd recommend the ramen (nothing like the packaged stuff you get for 20 cents, and you'd stock up and eat three times a day as a starving student).  I also love the udon noodles. \\n\\nIf you're more of a rice person, the unagi (freshwater eel) rice box is my husband's favorite.  But a recent price jump in the price (it used to be 11, and now is 17) is making him change his mind about what to order.  The sushi is decent, but this is not a sushi house, so keep that in mind.\\n\\nThe complimentary bread is awesome (although they don't give banana bread anymore, and that really was my favorite).  Lastly, as others have said the service isn't the best.  It's a bit slow, and they're always very crowded.  But take your time and enjoy the company you're with and you'll be fine!\",\n",

I offered the Gomoku Yaki Udon - pork was overcooked and overrun with whole calamari that still had eyes... Interesting decorating - Asian, Italian, and French with Christmas lights. Disappointed... :/',\n",
       " u\"One of the few fusion Japanese/Italian places in town that is actually decent quality (relatively far and few in Phoenix compared to California). The restaurant itself is quite small and seating is limited, but it is worth the wait.\\n\\nMy personal favorite if you are a fan of Udon noodle soup is the Udon Suki Iron Pot. The broth is very flavorful, udon perfectly slurpable, beef a little bit too lean but mixes well, and the egg totally rocks it. \\n\\nZaru Soba is a cold noodle dish that i have ordered and is quite good. it's not much on the dish besides the buckwheat noodle and you dipping it in the Soba soy sauce. Nice refreshing starch.\\n\\nSushi is ok but I would stick with the rice and noodle dishes.\\n\\nThe menu is quite extensive so I'll definitely return often to try out all the other options.\\n\\nDefinitely recommend this place as a solid lunch option for a reasonable price.\",\n",

I had almost given up hope :)  The meal was all around very good. The ramen my wife had was tasty but I would say the ramen at Monta in Las Vegas is better. The broth is much more flavorful.  All in all... this is a nice place to have here in the Valley... give it a try.\",\n",
       " u\"Our favorite ramen noodle place, hands down. Even San Francisco ramen can't compare. The Tan Tan Men is superb. Noodles perfectly cooked, with spicy flavorful broth. In fact, every dish here is prepared with an abundance of evenly balanced flavor and comes in generous sized proportions. The best gyoza, ramen, and spicy Korean beef, spicy potsticker hot pot, and pad Thai. The orange roughy is really good as well. Small place but can surprisingly seat a lot of people. The theme is Asian Paris. It's always crowded. Service can be slow but the food here is worth it!! Easily a Phoenix favorite.\",\n",

However, I must say that they do a great job of getting people seated in a timely fashion considering the lunch rush. Noise level was pretty average for that time of day and I can say I've been in louder places. The seating was comfortable, we were at a table right near the door so we had some good people watching. I liked the d\\xe9cor and lighting as well.\\nAppetizers - We got the fried/breaded veggies (forget what they're called) and Kioza (sp?)(pot stickers) They both were really good and not too heavy. It was perfect for three people.\\nEntr\\xe9e - I got the Chicken Parmesan and I must say, it is one of the best Chicken Parms I've ever had in my life. The chicken was breaded and baked to perfection; the noodles had the right consistency and although they could have done with a little more sauce and cheese, I can't say anything bad about it!\\nCan't comment on beverages because we all had water, but some of the drinks being served throughout the place looked quite tasty.\\nIf you're looking for Italian or Asian Noodle dishes, come check this place out and if you're in the mood DEFF TRY THE CHICKEN PARM!\",\n",
       " u\"This was one of the few times Yelp has led us wrong. Came here because it was close by & had 4 stars. \\n\\nI will say the service was perfectly fine. Our server was very friendly & even though it was busy, we were greeted at the door & sat quickly. \\n\\nUnfortunately, it was downhill from the point we got our food. We ordered an assortment of rolls & a dish of pad Thai. The sushi choices almost all include cream cheese &/or tempura, which made it difficult to choose a variety without everything tasting similar.\\n\\nThe sushi all tasted fishy. I don't think it was unfresh, but it certainly didn't taste fresh either. It was somewhere in between the two...if that is possible. The presentation wasn't bad either, but the overall experience was tainted by the poor tasting sushi.\",\n",

I can't wait to go back to this place and try something new.\",\n",
       " u\"Probably one of the fewest Japanese restaurants that are decent in AZ.  Nothing phenomenal but it is as good as it gets out here.

       " u'My last review of this place was 3/2011 and I still love the hell outta this place. The food is very good, varied, and inexpensive. They have a really great happy hour, too. My faves are their spicy Korean beef, crispy calamari, and sushi combo (great deal). \\n\\nService is consistently spotty. We went about a month ago and our server kept breaking glasses as she was really rushed. That was annoying as we were seated by where she was breaking the glasses. I love the bread they bring to the table but when I recently ordered takeout ($45 worth of food), the guy told me they no longer provide it free for takeout and would have to charge per roll. Cheap!!!\\n\\nRegardless, I love this place and will continue to return even if I have to deal with the inconsistencies.',\n",
       " u\"Just popped my Cherryblossom tonight... what a treat.\\n\\nWas greeted and seated promptly. Hostess had a side pony. Hip as ef.\\nSat down and met our server as he brought waters to the table. solid.\\n\\nPlace felt a bit crowded but still cozy and sexy like my favorite onesie...\\n\\nThe spicy Korean beef plate was littered with beef. So good it made it on my shirt as well... than was taken to mouth sex Ramen cove with a big bowl of the TanTan-men... lots of heat in my body was producing at an almost swampy rate and maintained till the last drop.\\n\\nOnly thing i see that can improve is knock down that silly wall that divides the two different rooms for seating (more viewable space will make it seem less crowded i promise). Also unless your a Village inn or a bakery you shouldn't have a dessert display? hope that is not just me thinking that. A bit cheesy and the servers I'm sure would love the extra room for service purposes. Maybe a new expo window??\\n\\nWill be back soon. Like tomorrow.\",\n",

I also saw it dressed with mayo salad dressing.  Wonder how that taste.   Definitely not good if you are watching your weight...;)\\n\\nThere was about four chefs cooking right in front of us because it was an open kitchen and we were sitting at the bar right in front of them.  We saw every dish that they pushed out and they were all made from scratch.  The ingredient was definately fresh and the chefs has skills.  It was impressive to watch.  They served chinese, vietnamese, korean, american, french, and japanese food from that four chefs...',\n",

       " u'Highlights of Christo\\'s\\n* The neighborhoody Italian cafe feel of the restaurant.\\n* Decent food with run-of-the-mill upscale Italian variety.\\n* Piano jazz player serenading guests.\\n* Crowd with a decidedly old-money North Central Phoenix feel as opposed to the \"I eat cat food and go to buffets\" Sun City feel. \\n* Professional servers with the memory of an elephant and the attitude of a menopausal woman.\\n\\nI had not been to Christo\\'s in a few years, but upon returning I found the food and atmosphere to be just as consistent.  The restaurant is very neighborhoody and inviting. The white tablecloths and piano player in the corner set the mood just right. You see diners here running into old friends at the bar. I did as well.  Little old bitties threw their judging looks our way from the bar, since our table of 20 is young, mostly female, we must all be lesbians, right?   Right.  \\n\\nConsistently good food, not great and not excellent, but good.   Modest soups and side salads here are part of the drill.  I ordered the chicken limone, breaded and prepared similar to chicken picatta but minus the capers.  I tasted my friend\\'s grilled salmon and penne and it was delicious. Considering out large party, the restaurant handled us OK, especially given the the busyness of the evening since it was Dining Out for Life evening where they donate proceeds toward HIV charities.\\n\\nI extended the benefit of the doubt, but expressed concerns over the somewhat long wait time.   It was nearly 10 pm when we left given our 7:30 reservations, in which we were promptly seated.  Our server,  who was skilled at reciting the dozen or so specials of the day, was accommodating, up until the billing situation (which I prepared him for beforehand) - when he turned a little catty, but all was well in the end. This is a 3 star place with potential for four stars.',\n",
       " u'Have been here twice, and the service and food have both been extremely good. They have a pretty good wine list too here.',\n",
       " u\"Again a great meal. I had the poached salmon, one of the best in a long time. As usual service was great and the food was outstanding, can't wait to try his sea bass .\",\n",
       " u\"Christo's is OK if your into three courses in less than 45 minutes. I was expecting to dine here but it was much more similar to a diner experience were you get whammed bammed and thank you'd as we were in and out in a jiffy.\\n\\nMy husband loves classic Italian Foods and according to reviews Christo's seemed like a top destination. Honestly in general the food was OK but not great and nothing I'd drive out of my way for. I almost never consider service as part of my review since it varies all the time everywhere but in this case it sort of even lessened the experience so MUCH that I have to consider it otherwise I would have given Christo's three stars.\\n\\nOur waiter quickly greats us and ask if we want the menu or the restaurant week special. Despite being around 70 years old he was very quick talking and very speedy and sort of made us nervous but what really bothered me the most was him  and his helpers standing there not to far from us with his arms crossed just watching us like a hawk eating the whole time. \\n\\nNow the food.\\n\\nI started with a Christo's Caesar Salad. I could tell the dressing was house made as well as the croutons. The dressing wasn't properly emulsified nor was it balanced in flavors and was super heavy with lemon. The croutons were crisp and buttery. I pointed out the faults since I know them but it really was an OK salad. I do note I wasn't offered fresh ground pepper, nicer restaurants do offer fresh ground pepper for Caesar Salads.\\n\\nI was sort of excited to have the classic dish Sole Meuniere here. The Christo's Version is nontraditional as the fish seemed heavily coated (maybe battered not sure) with flour in a lemon white wine sauce in stead of a traditional lightly floured and prepared in browned butter. The fresh spinach on the side was just plain without anything on it. \\n\\nDesserts seemed house made and were OK. We both liked the lemon cake better over the mousse.\\n\\nA glass of house wine was included with our dinners and during the meal we finished it and my husband ordered another round. He noticed a price difference from the menu and questioned our server. The server confirmed it wasn't the same price as the menu and said that for restaurant week they up charge the wine. It was only a few dollars but I feel this is bad business and not good for customer relations.\\n\\nI was really torn between two and three stars but the surprise of the wine up charge, being really rushed though dinner and with the waiter and his help all standing across from us just watching us the whole time in a unprofessional way sort of spoiled the dining experience.\\n\\n2.5 Stars\",\n",
       " u'Very good restaurant and staff. Low prices and moderate, sensible size portions. Veal chop was great.',\n",
       " u'Love this place!  It\\'s surely not hip, and I read another reviewer say it was for the blue hairs which might be true.  There is no way I could know since nobody but us was there mid-day.\\nBut the first course was soup or salad, and I picked an Italian soup which had spinach and parmesan in it and was so thick and delicious.  Then the veal I ordered was in a marsala sauce = excellent.  And the fresh veggies were steamed...well, to perfection.  Just a really great meal for only $10!  Talk about worth it!  This is a meal that IF you ordered it in one of the \"hip\" spots would cost $25+, so screw \"hip.\"\\nOK, granted the decor is the same old decor that was popular during the Frank Sinatra and his Rat Pack era--but I didn\\'t come for the decor.  We came to chat and, at least, this place didn\\'t have some blaring techno music, so we actually could hear each other.  See?  Very unhip.  But we could hear each other talk!  \\nThe service was super excellent...and darn! but I am having a really hard time finding many things not to like at Christo\\'s.  I like the place.  I plan to go back....soon.',\n",
       " u\"Rolberto's, I can't tell you how much I love you and how, when all others have abandoned me, you are always there for me right after the bars close but before I pass out. And even when I want to take you to bed with me, you've always been agreeable. Sometimes the only way I know for sure that I had a great night is when I wake up on the couch with a pounding headache and one of your  half-eaten Carne Asada burrittos on my chest.\\n\\nI love your nachos, your taquitos, I'm sure if I was into lengua I'd love that too. The only time you've ever let me down is the chorizo and egg buritto. Even though it was lacking in taste, I love everything else so much and you've been there for me on so many inebriated nights that, tasteless chorizo aside, I still l love you and know you'll ALWAYS be there for me.\",\n",

       " u\"Jordan's is seconds away from my office and I was craving cheap, run-of-the-mill Mexican food so we ran to Jordan's real fast. Expecting the typical Mexican restaurant with the typical wooden booths and plastic covered seats, I was surprised to find the interior was actually really nice. I was even more surprised to find the menu prices weren't as nice. Looking to spend no more than $7 on some tacos and rice and beans, I wasn't thrilled when I saw entrees for $12-$15.\\n\\nLuckily they have a killer (but limited) lunch menu for $5.95. To your table in 30 minutes or less or it's free. Of course, it came out in less than 14 minutes. And it was pretty good. I should have asked for soft tacos instead of hard but the meat was good and the toppings were decent. The salsa was odd though. I'm used to thick and chunky but this salsa reminded me of pasta sauce and that was odd but I ate it.\",\n",
       " u'Went here for lunch with Rand H. and this place is big for a chinese buffet , it is in the shell of an old Sizzler. The food here is pretty good i do not think i tried anything that was not at least average with most dishes above average.they had a couple of different items as well ,mexican chicken wings that tasted like they were cooked with oranges and shrimp balls that were pretty good..So yes i would go back even though it is not one of my favorite chinese buffet but it is a good one.',\n",
       " u\"Had lunch here today with Rand H and Mike C and compared to other Chinese buffets it's just okay.  Nothing was really bad (except the Lo Mein noodles that tasted like they cooked in a burnt pan) and nothing really stood out as being really good.  I guess they recently did the flooring, and I found it to be very slippery, not good when you're carrying plates of food.\\n\\nThey had a decent selection of the typical items found on similar buffets.  I did find most of the appetizer stuff, like crab rangoon and pot stickers were a little too greasy.  The fried and breaded shrimp was tasty and I did like their style of egg foo yung.  The staff barely spoke English and when Mike asked what something on his plate was, our waiter thought he was asking for more and brought them to him.  The service was attentive, but would have been better if they understood what we were asking for.  \\n\\nI wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, but if I was in the area and hungry and wanting a Chinese buffet, I'd definitely give them another chance.\",\n",

And, the amount of meat wasn't really a whole lot either...It gets worse....he got cole slaw for the side, and omg, it was served in a teeeny-tiny little plastic cup, about 1 inch in diameter...the kind of cup that is probably used for when you want extra sauce on something. Seriously now!...So, if he got fries instead, would the fries come in that same tiny cup??  oh brotther!

       " u'In my quest to try all the restaurants on 7th Street near my house, I decided to check out Pizza Heaven. Pizza Heaven is another one of those hole-in-the-wall eateries that you hear about via word-of-mouth. Oh sure, I can sit here and spout out multi-hyphenated phrases all day, but in the end, Pizza Heaven is a great little place to get a slice or two.\\n\\nYou can do just that. Their menu offers pizza by the slice. Or if you\\'re in a mood to share, you can order a whole conventional pie. Each slice is individually baked, so you should allay those fears of eating something that\\'s been sitting under a heat lamp for who-knows-how-long. They come out of the oven piping hot and delicious. The ongoing daily special is Two Cheese Slices and a fountain drink for $4.00. Toppings are 50 cents extra, per slice, which is still not a bad deal if you want to add pepperoni and still not break the bank.\\n\\nI first heard about Pizza Heaven when some of my coworkers, during their several-times-a-week (I\\'m trying to stop with the hyphenates, honestly) ritual of ordering take out, started to pass a menu around. Now, I may not be accustomed to traditional Italian calzones, but something that caught me off guard was the fact that the calzone came with ricotta cheese as opposed to mozzarella. On recent visits, I\\'ve specified mozzarella be used rather than their default of ricotta. Other items ordered by my colleagues included Angel Bread Sticks, Meatball Parmigiana Stuffed Sandwich and the Insalata Caprese. There wasn\\'t one item that they delivered that didn\\'t look good. The menu also offers a whole wheat crust option and you can order your pizza with soy cheese if you feel the need. Other items on the menu I have yet to try include various pasta dishes, chicken wings (your choice of Mild, Medium, Hot or the painful-sounding \"Suicide\" variety) and desserts which include Cheesecake and Tiramisu.\\n\\nI had actually eaten Pizza Heaven\\'s dishes several times before actually setting foot in the restaurant thanks to their quick delivery service to my place of business. When I ultimately made it there in the flesh, the first thing I noticed was how clean it was inside. The menu touts that Channel 3 News gave them the distinction of  \"Cleanest Kitchen in the Valley\". I would have to agree that if the kitchen looks anything like the rest of the interior, then they keep things in excellent and sanitary condition. The restaurant has also been awarded New Times \"Best of Phoenix\" award and although I haven\\'t tried too many other local pizza places, I would have to agree that the award was well-deserved.\\n\\nFor those of you who don\\'t want to pull yourself away from the comfort of your couch and your precious XBox, you can have your food delivered for a minimum of a $15 order. Whether or not the driver will be gracious enough to feed it to you so you won\\'t have to pause your gameplay is entirely at his or her discretion, and I\\'m sure will require a larger tip.',\n",
       " u'it is a really cool place. Good Pizza but nothing crazy. Great for a quick lunch. \\n\\nJust watch out they only take debit if it is over $5. The lunch special is not over $5.

       " u\"The quality of food here is fantastic. Very good value for the price. They are happy to customize anything for you, especially the pizza. There are vegetarian options. Good salads and sandwiches. Tasty pasta dishes. Free wifi.

       " u\"This place is very tasty and the service is always friendly.  The prices aren't bad, either.\\n\\nThe downside is that the owner's son fancies himself a musician, so if you go there on the wrong night, you're treated to some pretty middling live music.  It's nice that they are supportive of him, but sometimes I just want to eat pizza and have a conversation with my friends.  If the band is playing or setting up, you might wanna consider getting your pizza to go.\",\n",
       " u'I personally was not overly excited about the pizza, but my girlfriend and I also split an order of some crazy spicy chicken pasta - it was absolutely awesome.

       " u\"This may have been some of the best Italian take out I have had in the midtown/downtown Phoenix area in a long time. The husband and I picked up some delicious food here last night. We split a calzone with pepperoni and basil, a side of meatballs, and an order of garlic bread. Total? 18$...whaaaat?!?! Awesome! and it was a ton of food too. The meatballs were really good, soft, but not too soft, and flavorful. The garlic bread was nothing too special, but it was standard. The calzone was very good. They loaded this thing with basil, it wasn't like a little bit here and there, so I appreciated that. Additionally, it had a lot of pepperoni...too much for me, but the husband loved that. They top the calzone with garlic and bake until it's golden brown.... this thing was so delicious and large, we certainly had leftovers. I also found out that this place will deliver all the way out to my house at 15th ave and mcdowell....awesome! This may be my new go to pizza. \\n\\n\\nPS this place is very accommodating, they have vegan and gluten free menus... awesome!\",\n",
       " u\"First time I got it... I was not impressed.  But let me tell you... ordering a pizza with a whole wheat crust instead of the default crust makes a WORLD OF DIFFERENCE!.  The pizza went from tasting identical to Papa John's (with the normal crust).. to taste phenomenal (with the whole wheat crust)!\\n\\nSo happy I gave this place I second chance!\",\n",
       " u\"Ok, a bit of explanation why I gave this place 2 stars.  The food is good...it is your traditional lasagna, ravioli, and pasta fare.  Not the best I've had, but it tastes great when you're craving traditional Italian.  However, the service here is so slow that it literally took almost 2 hours for me to get my food.  The waitress was stressed out, even though the place wasn't busy.  So I think there may have been a staffing problem the day I went.  Maybe I'll try it again some day and see if the service gets better.\",\n",

I had the shredded beef chimichanga with a side of refried beans.  The meat was juicy, slightly spicy and the chimi was fried just right.\\n\\nOverall, I'd be back!\",\n",
       " u\"A year later, I'm back at Ajo Al's and still like it just as much as last time.  It's a little heavy on the salt, but whatever.   The steak Chuy's Chimi was awesome, not overcooked.  The waitress made sure to let me know it's covered in green sauce, and substituting red wasn't a problem.  \\n\\nThe service was great - never had to ask for a refill, the chip bowl never went empty.\\n\\nDelicious, reliable, what more do you want?\",\n",
       " u\"I was up in this part of town at lunchtime today, so I whipped in here to Al's.  This is a stylish, good-sized place, & it was already almost full of lively diners at 11:45!\\n\\nThings got off to a good start, with a whole pitcher of ice water landing on the table, along with a basket of excellent chips & a nice carafe of tasty salsa.  I ordered a #7 Combo, which arrived pretty soon as a roasting hot platter with a Chile Relleno, a beef tamale, a hard shredded beef taco, & a bit of salad.\\n\\nThe prices are a little high (but obviously they are getting away with it), & they give you a small plate to scoop up your salsa from, instead of a more useful bowl, but of course you can get one for the asking.\\n\\nThe service was good, & this was a big, delicious lunch.  I don't know if Al is really an A-Ho.., but he can cook!     :-))\\n\\n#7 Combo $11.45\",\n",
       " u\"I am not sure why everyone loves this place so much.   I went here many years ago and I liked it better then.   Chips were good, salsa was tasty but not very spicy.  I asked our server whether the red or green chile was spicier.  He stated the salsa was hotter than either of them.  I am glad he was honest but I was a little disappointed.  I had the spinach enchiladas which were actually quite tasty.  Wait staff was very attentive.    It's not terrible, but I like my mexican food with a little sting to it!\",\n",
       " u\"Weak.  This place is a far cry from the Mill Ave. location in Tempe.  Gone now.  Long Wong's quality is lost on this place.  I had pizza and wings and my slice was literally microwaved to heat it up after I ordered.  Bad, bad, bad.  Wings have always been decent, but there's really no reason to go there ever again.\",\n",
       " u\"If you could imagine what a restaurant would look like if you gave someone acid and told them to do some interior decorating, I am pretty sure this would be the outcome.  The outside includes statues of geese, hippos, buffalo's,  and assortment of other creatures.  The inside is wall to wall with stuff from Humpty Dumpty to an American flag to totem pole.   If only the food compared with this quirky atmosphere...\\n\\nLong Wong's gets one star because the FOOD WAS AWFUL.  I ordered boneless chicken wings.  They were so hard and inedible that I broke my plastic fork trying to stab one to pick it up.  I am not talking a little freezer burn here but am talking hard as a rock.  The medium buffalo wing sauce was hot but had no flavor.  I also had a hot dog.  The bun was super stale and fell apart as I tried to eat the hot dog.  \\n\\nThe Costco style tables were filthy.  My child's high chair table is cleaner after she eats than the table we sat at.\\n\\nIf you bring your own food and table, you can enjoy the atmosphere. Otherwise, I highly don't recommend.\",\n",
       " u\"I always drive by and wonder what kind of food such a crazy looking place can serve.  Stopped in one night craving wings, and just about everything on the menu was screaming to get ordered.\\nI ended up with a dozen spicy BBQ wings and a side of fried zucchini and mushrooms.  For the price, it really couldn't get any better.  The wings were hot and crunchy, covered in a sweet but spicy BBQ sauce.  The zucchini and mushrooms were fried fresh, so good!\\nEverything is really affordable and the eclectic decor is fun to look at while you're getting messy with some wings.\",\n",
       " u\"First time I went here I ordered a Long Wong, BIG MISTAKE. The long wong was a hotdog smothered in EZ-CHEESE and tasted like cancer, so I avoided this place for awhile after. Later on I came back to try the wings and damn they were good! Well the suicide wings were, only ones I got. But for 12, they were cheap, LW's didn't skimp on the dip, and they had a good burn to them. Definitely worth the price if you don't feel like cooking and want to go out and get some cheap spicy wings.\",\n",
       " u'Basic hole in the wall greasy fried food.  Really good prices.  Can be a bit slow and can get pretty crowded.  I have only tried their wings and some of their fried items, not the burgers or pizza.  Overall mediocre food, but a pretty good deal if you are feeding a large family or group.',\n",
       " u'I have fond memories of Long Wong\\'s from my childhood. My parents were divorced, so my dad pretty much always took me out to dinner on his nights. Long Wong\\'s was a solid part of the rotation, and not just because I only ate cheeseburgers. The place is crazy looking. Literally, the decor looks like it was inspired by an acid trip. Nothing says \"kid friendly\" like a hippopotamus trash can. If you are a single dad who doesn\\'t know how to cook, you should definitely take your kid here for dinner. \\n\\nSince it had been at least two decades since I\\'d been inside a Long Wong\\'s, last night my boyfriend and I decided to check it out. We had a craving for wings (I accidentally typed that I had a crazing for wings, which I\\'m pretty sure is the exact same thing)  and you can get a bucket of 50 for, like, $25. Going to be honest ... 50 wings might have been a bit overkill for two people. Still, it was worth it. \\n\\nWe did a split order: 1/2 honey hot and 1/2 medium. The honey hot wings are where it\\'s at. My only complaint is that I like them to be a little crispier. Some of them were slightly soggy. The fries didn\\'t travel well either. In fact, everything was just kind of soggy by the time we got home. The wings were still very good, but I think they will be even better once I give the leftovers a little crisp in the oven. I will say, their homemade ranch was delicious. Can\\'t beat a hot wing dipped into good, homemade ranch. \\n\\nI\\'m definitely going to have to keep this place in mind the next time a wing craving hits ... and maybe ask for them extra crispy.',\n",
       " u\"Ok...so my first review of this place, if I had my way the health inspector would have closed it and subway would have needed to send me a check for damages for my personal distress.\\n\\nWheres Johnny Cochran when ya need him!  \\n\\nThis is kind of what happened to this location, they closed down and remodeled, I would have to say that since the remodel, this place has kind of cleaned up a bit, and they do have some pretty good employees, there is one fat girl that works there now that is a bit rude still, like she hates life and everybody in it because she is overweight, but for the most part the rest of the staff is pretty good. The food is how can you say, what you would expect, it's a sandwich buffet with some one else making the sandwich, I mean I could probably never give this place 5 stars, but as far as fast food places go this place is up to par.\",\n",
       " u'Eating here is not just eating, it is an event.  The food is good, but one of my best friends is greek and so I have tasted better, but the entertainment is worth the trip.  They have a great band that plays for a long time and a good belly dancer that brings people out to dance with her.  The owner is very enthusiastic and he dances as well.  You get to break plates (you have to pay for them, only $2).  All in all a great dining experience.',\n",
       " u'HAD A BLAST AT BACCHANAL!!!!! If you want to have a really good time, decent drinks and food, and BREAK SOME PLATES  go here!!!  The belly dancers got a lot of people active in the dancing! OPA!',\n",
       " u'So fun and so yummy!  We had a blast with our big group and the food was fantastic.',\n",
       " u\"I heart (attack) Texaz Grill. My tummy (arteries) were filled with good ole, down home cooking. My NY strip was perfection and dripping with flavor (cholesterol). Rickie's a Texas boy so he knows his chicken fried anythings, and his chicken fried chicken was smothered in love (gravy) and he nibbled every bite (inhaled like there's no tomorrow). I chased my taters, sauteed shrooms and steak down with a cold Dos XX and a Patron shot. All this with attentive and friendly service. The room reminded me of the shack Steve Martin lived in, in the beginning of The Jerk. And for this place, the license plates, posters and bric a brac that cover every corner, including the ceiling above the urinal, yes, guys get this...when you have to pee so badly, you arch your  head back with an eye rolling groan...that's how I saw the posters on the ceiling. But all the kitchy crap everywhere works for Texaz Grill. The menu has all kinds of steaks and wonderful sides. The only thing missing is a defibrillator.\",\n",
       " u\"My sister and I ate here twice on our Phoenix vacation.  It's not fancy by any means, but the food is delicious, cheap, and the service is great.  The walls are covered with everything even remotely related to Texas, like caps, license plates, animals, pictures, etc.  We loved this place.  Parking is tight, but worth it.\",\n",
       " u'I went here tonight after hearing good things about the place. I was very disappointed. The food servings were large but the food itself was not very good. The Chicken Fried Steak had no real taste at all. It was just bland. The pork chops were good but not great. Salad just a salad and the bread was cold. I do not think I will be going back after spending $46 dollars for so-so food. Very disappointing.',\n",
       " u'Take a little slice of Texas hospitality (and portion size) and drop it onto an unsuspecting corner of Phoenix.  That gives you Texaz.\\n\\nThis place features some of the finest chicken fried steak I\\'ve had the pleasure of eating.  It was accompanied by genuine mashed potatoes, buttery corn, and a hearty biscuit.  The portions are as generous as the brim of a texan\\'s hat.\\n\\nThis is also one of the few places you\\'ll find Arizona where you can find Shiner Bock, the finest Texas beer.  If you hurry there now, you can probably still get the Shiner Bohemian Black Lager - a fine tasty beverage.\\n\\n(They serve beers in a bottle accompanied by a curiously small frosted glass.  If you\\'re not from the southwest, don\\'t be alarmed.  I hear it\\'s \"normal\" in the desert lands.)\\n\\nAll in all, the food was delicious and the owners have instilled a genuine appreciation of the customer that shines through in the service.  This place is about as fine of a casual dining spot as I\\'ve found in my travels!\\n\\nBring your appreciation for Conway Twitty and a hearty appetite.  Yee-haw!',\n",
       " u\"There's a reason this place has sold over 700,000 chicken fried steaks!  We went here last night and that's exactly what I ordered.  I couldn't believe the amount of food I got once it was there.  The hot gravy on top of it, along with a side of mashed potatoes.  Amazing.  \\n\\nBefore dinner though, they bring out fresh biscuits, which I quickly buttered up and coated with honey.  \\n\\nThis review was based on my own dinner.  The four stars was for the chicken friend steak.  Im being generous because on the downside, the salads we got seem wilted and old.  Our waitress at times was too busy talking to people than checking to see if we were ready to order or go.\\nMy girlfriend got shish kabobs and wasn't too much of a fan.. especially after she tried my CFS.  haha.. My friend got the pork chops and it seemed too much fried food. Weird? \\n\\nOverall it was good, but there was room for improvement.\",\n",
       " u'This place at one time seemed too \"high concept\", but multiple visits have convinced me that it is rather genuine: A plain-old Texas cultural embassy.\\n\\nI think I\\'ve never had a bad meal there. The steaks could be thicker, I suppose. And they do grease \\'em up before they grill \\'em, but the over all effect with the mashed potatoes is pretty satisfying.\\n\\nI always get a Shiner Bock when I\\'m there. At one time it was one of the few restaurants in the valley that had them available.\\n\\nParking is pretty bad, and the seats could be more comfortable. But basically, come hungry and leave happy.',\n",
       " u\"This place is delightful.  Full of all things Texas, delicious chicken friend chicken, filet, great mashed potatoes, I strongly recommend this place.\\n\\nSee Stephen B's review: every time I see a boarded-up Lone Star Steak House, and now there are PLENTY OF THEM!, I smile a little smile for Texaz Grille, forced to change their name after then-20 years of operation.  \\n\\nBy the way, some of the best cole-slaw I've ever had!\",\n",
       " u\"Well, I am clearly not the first to wax poetic about the chicken fried steak here. I miss the signage on the south side of the building with the count of how many have been sold.\\n\\nOnce upon a time, this was Lone Star. Then the chain came into town, and the name was changed to TexAz. Happily, that's the only thing that's changed.\\nI've had many meals here - and have never left hungry.\\n\\nRecently, the pattern has been a girlfriend and I meeting for lunch. We have iced teas (since I have to go right to work after), small salads and split a chicken fried steak. The plate comes with corn and a heaping pile of mashed potatoes with gravy. Ohhhh, that gravy!\\nWe save the biscuits for last - and smother them with butter and honey - dessert!\\n\\nEverything has always been fresh and tasty. No culinary risks here, and nothing pushing the food envelope - just straightforward Texas comfort food. With some added flair. Cajun/Creole flavors make lots of appearances - and it all hits the spot.\\n\\nThe decor can be overwhelming - but there's so much eye candy it's impossible to be bored. Love all the signs and bumper stickers. Most are Texas-centric, but there are artifacts from all over the globe. (Personal note - three cheers for all the Kinky Friedman items!)\\n\\nGood food, good drink, good times - HUGE portions at very fair prices!\\n\\nOh - and the bread pudding with whiskey sauce is kinda amazing!!\",\n",
       " u'The food is so good that I wish I could eat there every day. I love their lunch time specials.  Tuesday is a must for ham steak  Wednesday is a must for liver and onions .  Thursdays for ribs or prime rib (almost a half pound).  Friday is the best fish in town.\\nNancy, the werver is simply great!',\n",
       " u'I am so confused by all of the ratings. I\\'ve tried this place twice now hoping that things would be better and that I just ordered the wrong items but I was, yet again, very disappointed. The only thing this place has going for itself is that they have large portions.\\n\\nAs for the food, it should be called Tex\"ass\" Grill!\\n\\nFirst time I visited, my boyfriend and I ordered the ribs meal. The ribs were dry and extremely salty. The sides weren\\'t any better either. Their potatoes were bland and coleslaw was over-dressed. \\n\\nSeeing the highly rated reviews on their Chicken Fried Steak, I hoped my most recent visit would bring redemption to this restaurant, but, boy was I wrong!\\n\\nTheir Chicken Fried Steak was bland as was their gravy and mashed potatoes! They didn\\'t bother to season the meat and it seems like it was just dredged in season-less flour batter. The gravy was flavorless as well. \\n\\nI really wanted to like it but my taste buds fought against me. I felt dirty trying to take another bite because I kept trying to fool myself into thinking I tasted the meat... or the batter... or the gravy... or the potatoes. My last bite of redemption... the biscuit.... which was also flavorless! What happened to buttery, flaky biscuits? They would be well inclined to consult the Pillsbury Dough Boy for some pointers because those taste 100% better.\\n\\nDisappointment and empty stomachs filled my household for the rest of the evening. At least something was full.',\n",
       " u'Chicken fried steak = winner, catfish = winner, anything else I have tried = winner.  Great spot, good portions, and friendly + quick staff.  \\n\\nEnough said, except a Thank You TEXAZ!',\n",
       " u\"Texaz Grill is amazing! I've been dinning there since I was a child. There's no place like it in the city. The decor is very unique and not like something you have seen before if raised in phoenix. The place is always packed I've never seen it not busy. Very welcoming staff as well. They serve the best home style cooked delicious food. I usually always get their specialty the chicken fried steak. It's defiantly my favorite and the main reason I keep coming back. It's a huge helping, almost falling off the plate because it's so big and you get 2 pieces with 2 sides! They also have great BBQ, fried foods, deserts, a great wine and beer list, and so much more. If you haven't tried texaz grill you must go!\",\n",

       " u'This has been on my AZ bucket list for years and decided to drop by tonight for dinner with the family. From chatting it up with some of the regulars, to the \"Texas Trivia\" with the owner at our table. The food and the vibe here were absolutely wonderful. Will definitely be back again and again!',\n",

       " u\"I've always loved this place. Texas food is always good. I enjoy this place but just can't come here to often. TEXAZ is an unassuming place on the outside and settled in a very tight corner of the shopping center. Like I said very unassuming. Once you walk in then BOOM. It's like a time warp taking you back to Texas in the 1970's. Place is decorated with old pictures related to Texas, road signs, animal heads, caps, and old license places. Very interesting and very loud. Everyone talking, eating, and having a good time. \\n\\nWe started out with our usual fries okra. This is the only place I can find fried okra in AZ. Nice change of pace. Love the okra. Nice and crisp. Love it. So I ordered their famous Chicken Fried Steak. They say it's the best in AZ and I can't disagree. All meals comes with a side salad. Salad doesn't look that appetizing but it's not bad. House dressing is pretty good. Anyways, the CFS comes with two huge pieces hanging off the plate smothered with gravy and comes with mash potatoes. Very crispy and fresh. Not greasy at all. Really good. Best in AZ hands down. Only problem is that it's too much food. I couldn't even come close to to finishing it. I saw two guys at a table across from us share an order of CFS. Very smart and would probably recommend sharing this huge meal. My wife ordered the Fried Catfish. Two large pieces of fish with a side of mash potatoes. Wife loved it. Not greasy at all. Fresh and moist but again a lot of food. So good. Everyone's ordering the CFS and fried catfish. There's a reason. \\n\\nMy son ordered the prime rib regular cut. Really big piece of meat with a side of mash potatoes. My son really liked the prime rib. He's a fussy eater and he really like the prime rib. So when he likes it then I know it's really good. Looked juicy and fresh. \\n\\nWe were stuffed with all this food. Packed up our leftovers but you can't leave this place without dessert. We shared the pecan pie. Oh my gosh. Your probably laughing right now but this is the best pecan pie. Had pecan pie from Texas and all over and this is the best I've had. It had a hard topping that most pecan pies don't have. A little chewy and not as sweet as most pecan pie. Crust is outstanding. Hands down yummy. \\n\\nSo the food was really really good. The service was also outstanding. Once we sat down our server was there for our drunk orders. Food was brought to our table really fast and they cleaned off our dirty dishes very quickly. We also had our server and owner check on us to make sure everything is okay. Everyone makes you feel at home just like in Texas. \\n\\nSo good food (aka little too much), good service, and good dessert. Enjoy and bring a wheel barrow to roll you out. It's that good.\",\n",
       " u'The difficulty of finding a place to park was the first problem we encountered at Texaz, but after circling the block we saw someone backing out, parked and went into the restaurant. The noise level was too high, but we had so much time invested already that we decided to stay. \\nMy salad consisted of a mountain of lettuce on a plate that was too small for it. As I ate, bits fell off my plate no matter how careful I was. I gleaned so many pieces of lettuce from the table and my lap that I built a little hillock. When the waitress came for the plate I quickly scooped up the pile with my hands and put it on top of the remainder of the lettuce on the little plate. She asked me if I wanted a box for my \"salad.\"  Really. The lettuce mess was neither my fault nor hers, and I realize it is the server\\'s job to clear the table, but it did happen on my watch so I would have felt churlish leaving it for her to clean up. She had liberally sown the floor with morsels of food fallen from over-filled plates being carried to diners, but least the hostess was constantly sweeping up the mess on the floor.\\nAfter asking whether the rib eye or the New York would be the most tender I ordered the rib eye. When it came it took a monumental effort to cut it. I am strong, so I managed to hack off a couple of bites and finally complained that it was too tough. I was scolded for not ordering a filet in the first place and was asked if I would rather have that. It was a clumsy job of upselling, but I agreed to try one. As I waited for it to be cooked I couldn\\'t keep from staring in morbid fascination at the ocean of gravy sloshing over the gunnel of the overfilled plate across from me. The so-called filet finally came and had the stringy texture of tenderized meat, not the buttery texture of a good filet, and it would have been a nice touch to comp me the difference between the rib eye and the filet, but I was charged the difference. The time to recommend the filet would have been when I first asked about tenderness, not after I had wrestled with the tough rib eye.\\nOur visit to Texaz is not one we will repeat.\\n\\nPS Although we are seniors we would agree with the post below about the lack of seasoning. Some salt and a couple of squirts of Sriracha would work wonders.',\n",
       " u\"The food is good, that's already been expressed. The service is amazing!!!! From the greeting, to bringing constant refills, to pleasing the children (nephew).  It's like going to a Deep South restaurant where the staff goes out of their way to make sure you're comfortable. It sounds cheesy, but I'll admit I was hesitant to go in this restaurant because it doesn't look friendly from the outside. So I guess my vibe reader was wrong. Oh- and great lemonade!\",\n",
       " u\"I don't go to Moto very often, even though it's across the street from my  house.  I've really only been for dinner and take out.  It's been good, standard fare.  Nothing spectacular, but good.  The fish has been better than some places.  And the AYCE sushi special on Saturdays for $15.95 is a great deal.\\n\\nToday I went to lunch with a PG girlfriend, so, no raw fish for her.  We decided to share two dishes, the sweet & sour shrimp and the veggie pad thai.  While the serving of pad thai was huge, I thought that $8.95 for no meat was a little steep, it's $12.95 to add chicken, beef, shrimp or tofu.  And the shrimp bowl was good, the sauce was tasty and not too sweet, but only 5 pieces of shrimp.  Not a value.\\n\\nSince they don't have a lunch menu, I think I'll stick to Moto for happy hour and for dinner and AYCE on Saturdays.\",\n",
       " u'*** Edited on April 13, 2008 to add this new bad experience. I\\'m thinking about changing my rating to ONE STAR because the experience.\\n\\nWent to Moto at 9:35 PM on Sat April 13 April night. Sign states they close at 10 PM. Waitress and Host made us stand in doorway like dicks while they \"decide\" if they are still \"open.\" \\n\\nThey hem and haw and \"say hold on.\" I asked what time they stop seating and they said \"10:00 PM.\" I ask them what time it is. Instead of answering me directly, the waitress says \"fine, we\\'ll seat you.\" We start to walk to the table and she adds \"but you have to order fast.\"\\n\\nFUCK THAT!\\n\\nSo I tell her, \"thanks but no thank you\" and leave.\\n\\nThat was Saturday night.\\n\\nORIGINAL REVIEW: I\\'ll start backwards, at the end of my experience. The dessert is fricking awesome! The rice crispy sushi roll ice cream thing is out of this world. Holy goodness it\\'s yummy.\\n\\nThey also offer a nice selection of beer and the drink menu is diverse. The sake selection is not so great, but they do offer fun mixed drinks to make up for it.\\n\\nAs for the food - I would give it a B+. Maybe A-. The Asian nachos app. was actually pretty interesting (in a good way). The sushi was pretty good too. Not the best, but good. \\n\\nOur server was a little strange. We couldn\\'t decide if she was a little rude or just ditzy. But the host/door guy was great so at least we know they are capable of decent service.\\n\\nMoto is a pretty solid place. I kind of wish it were downtown Phoenix rather than so far up north, but I guess a girl can\\'t have everything she wants, right?\\n\\nI\\'ll be back to Moto soon, for sure. but the service needs much improvment.',\n",
       " u'Mediocre sushi and god-awful service. My wife and I, both ex-servers from our college years, tried them three times. Every time the service was infuriating and the food bland. Save your money.',\n",
       " u\"Service was good - I was disappointed by a lukewarm miso soup and almost cold brown rice.  We ordered the sushi/sashimi platter to share, and it tasted fine with an okay presentation. The green tea is unique and refreshing. We ordered the small Moto for dessert - and that was delicious and a small was plenty for two people.  Overall, if I was really craving sushi and I was near 16th Street and Glendale, I'd go again, but I wouldn't go out of my way for Moto.\",\n",
       " u'Moto is pretty high up there in the sushi world for me. I love my sushi so it take a good place to impress me. \\n\\nI first went to Moto for their All-You-Can-Eat Saturdays. IN the beginning it wasn\\'t nearly as strict as it is now, but rightfully so they had to implement some rules(Don\\'t be a gluten, no sharing, $0.50 per piece you have leftover that they will box up for you to take home, must eat all the rice as well...). They offer just about any kind of sushi you would want for about $18 per person, or $22 per person if you want Saki with it, still a fab deal! \\n\\nMy other favorite there is their chicken terriacki bowl, probably the best I have had in a long time. They have a \"built your own\" style bowl menu, very good, check it out! \\n\\nOver all Moto is good, but a once in awhile venture.',\n",
       " u\"I have never eaten inside the place but I may go for the AYCE thing on a Saturday. \\n\\nI've ordered take out on a few occasions and really liked it. I am a very judgmental sushi eater! I love unagi and the flavor has to be just right! So the dragon rolls to have impressed me is a big deal. I also ordered the tuna tataki that just wasn't seasoned as well as other places but overall enjoyable. The chicken katsu is very tasty, panko breading makes anything good though, and comes with asian slaw that isn't overly tart  and the brown rice was cooked well. My son loves those desert rolls, the little fatty! \\n\\nI've ordered by phone and gone in to order and either way the staff has been friendly and helpful. \\n\\nI like this place and even though I have moved farther from this place than other sushi restaurants I will continue to go there until I am thoroughly disappointed.\",\n",
       " u'This place caught my eye because of it\\'s fun, trendy atmosphere vibe and the sassy menu (check it out online - you\\'ll see what I mean) made me think this place was worth trying. What better time to try it then on a fun date night with the fiance?\\n\\nWell, it\\'s definitely got the fun, trendy atmosphere and yep, the menu is still amusingly sassy and clever. As for the food, well...the sushi is....decent. I believe another earlier yelper described it perfectly as \"passable.\" Don\\'t get me wrong, it wasn\\'t bad in any way it just wasn\\'t as good as other sushi I\\'ve had. My fiance and I ordered three rolls between the two of us and we felt that it was mostly rice, not enough fish and not enough flavor. The spicy tuna was just not spicy enough for me - not enough sriracha in my opinion - but that\\'s just me. Overall, our stomachs left Moto Sushi satisfied from hunger but not overly excited about anything else. \\n\\nPlus, I have to share that I had my most strange sushi restaurant experience while at Moto when the couple on a date at the table next to ours loudly proclaimed that they hate seafood and proceeded to order buffalo chicken wings - which they then ate with chopsticks - just baffled me.\\n\\nIt must be the combination of the sushi and the customers but I just didn\\'t feel like I was in the right place for a great Japanese dinner. It almost felt like it was a restaurant that just happened to serve sushi but everything else about the place doesn\\'t match. It just felt....off. It may be worth going back just to see what else is on their clever, sassy menu but only if we happen to be in the area.',\n",
       " u\"This is a local hotspot.  I've been going here for years and the employees say hello to you when you walk in.  Happy hour sushi M-F 3-6:15, all you can eat sushi on Saturday from 11-2:30, happy again on Sundays until 6pm I believe.  Different micro brews all of the time-always fun to taste :)  Check it out for yourself!\",\n",
       " u'Good sushi and nice sized plates for the price. Haven\\'t tried drinks yet but its on the to-do list. Figure out the hidden menu before you go, if thats your kind of thing. I always feel weird ordering off of it, but it makes them smile.\\nGo for happy hour and save some happy money for that pocket of yours!\\nAnd if you\\'re anything like me.. you will walk through the door and think \"HELLO MOTO!\"',\n",
       " u\"Moto does everything good, but it never rises to great. They have an eclectic menu and there's tons for non-sushi eaters, too. Good value for dollar spent and usually walk away full and happy.\",\n",
       " u\"Ordered a specialty roll that was $14 dollars called the mayflower and it didn't live up to my expectations. It had more cucumber then tuna and forgot the cream cheese and avocado. It should have been called the cucumber roll with a slab of tuna on top. The following day my friend and I became violently ill with food poisoning!  I will never go anywhere near MOTO again after this experience.\",\n",
       " u\"This Business has been my go to Sushi restaurant for some time now. It's a small quaint establishment. The food is good and and they have a great selection for everyone...even if you don't like sushi. The only reason I did not give them 5 stars is because sometimes the food does take a little to long to get to you, and the business  it self is kind of small. There isn't a lot of seating especially when it's busy. \\nOtherwise, I enjoy eating here and will continue to frequent Moto.\",\n",
       " u'Go there for lunch often and I\\'m treated like Norm at Cheers. Love they remember my name. The servers and sushi chefs ( especially Ivan) can cut and roll some sushi! They have an underground menu you can pick from or just tell Ivan what you want in your roll ( custom)! I order the \"Sasquatch\" roll and I\\'m thoroughly satisfied. The noodles and any of the bowls there rival any sushi place around. They change out their beers weekly so you can enjoy many local brews. Try the \"stoner\" bowl and enjoy the spicy chicken/ ranch/ rice mix. Great for a hangover. It\\'s local, its comfortable and it has a great happy hour on Friday.',\n",
       " u\"They have a good happy hour on Sundays. Sushi is pretty good but I didn't like the nachos.\",\n",
       " u\"I love this place. The food is always delicious. I came for lunch today and had Pho which was as good as any Vietnamese place I've gone to. I don't know my waitresses name but she was adorable, extremely nice and attentive. Dinner can get very busy and the wait times can get long, but it's worth it.\",\n",
       " u\"I just wish there was a Luke's in Flagstaff!  Try the Combo, beef and sausage, that requires a roll of paper towels to mop up the drippings.  It is so good.  And the Italian sub is bravo delicious!  \\n\\nThe place is tiny and crowded, but it's places like this where stuff of legend comes from.  Amazing sandwiches.  Have always encountered friendly staff with quick service.\",\n",
       " u\"I've never been disappointed at Luke's! And this comes from a Chicago kid who used to eat their pizza puffs back in the day! Everything about the beef or meatball sandwiches is perfect.\\n\\nI'm glad they've started offering a smaller version of the beef sandwich - now I CAN order Pizza puffs to go with a small beef. The net result is a small bit of heaven shines down into my me. Ahh, Lukes...\",\n",
       " u\"In my quest for the best Italian Beef sandwich in Phoenix, I took the advice of a friend from Chicago and tried Lukes.  I must say that it was very good.  The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars was because of the peppers, and giardinieri.  The meat was excellent, as was the bun.  If I was rating the sandwich strictly based on that I would have give it 5 stars.  The au jus was fantastic as well.  And they dipped it perfectly.  It was soggy like it should be, but I could still pick it up and eat it.  The only issue I had was the peppers and giardinieri.  I get mine with both hot and sweet peppers.  The giardiniera lacked something.  For one thing there was not enough of it on the sandwich so it was missing that spicy kick.  The sweet peppers were not cut up, so it was just one big roasted red and green pepper.  Slicing it up smaller helps when eating the sandwich.\\n\\nThe only other issue I had was the price.  After adding both peppers, small fries, and a small coke, my bill came to $12.40.  That's about 4-5 dollars more than I pay for the same thing at other places.\",\n",
       " u'Get the beef',\n",
       " u\"Heard through friends that this is the place to go for good ol' Chicago food.  I'm from Chicago so I'm kind of an expert. :) At first, we were not impressed.  We arrived about 20 minutes after they opened and we did not even see an employee for 10 minutes. He was running a 1 man show and cooking up the order that was ahead of us. He finally took our order with no apology for the wait but let me tell you, the food was worth the wait. I had the pepper and egg sandwich, Amazing!!!  My boyfriend had a chili dog and fries which he said was really good!  We'll definitely go back, hopefully the service will be better. I have a feeling that his co-worker was late and that was the problem, still not an excuse though.\",\n",
       " u\"so I finally decided to come back to Lukes. I had been several years ago, but never made it back. I went for the Italian beef and sausage combo sandwich with provolone and sweet peppers.  It set me back just over $9.00. A tad pricey, but it was a pretty good sandwich. The bread was very fresh and the beef seemed to be very well seasoned. it also came with a cup of Jus, that it definitely needed. I'll def go back if I'm ever in the mood for an Italian beef sandwich, but I'd prob skip the sausage next time.\",\n",
       " u'Had a really good beef and sausage combo dipped in aujus (gravy).  Make sure you ask for extra gravy.  I will be back!',\n",
       " u\"I love Luke's! Originally, I was referred to them by my girlfriend's parents who swear by this place. I have had their Italian hot beef, their burgers, and hot dogs and I am always completely satisfied. A little greasy, but well worth the money!\",\n",
       " u\"Goddamn I wanted a french dip tonight. Meaty, juicy shavings of meat in a soft roll with a warm au jus. That's all I wanted.\\n\\n5 & Diner gave me a prime rib dip, which didn't quite satisfy. The bread was great, but the meager spat of buttery prime rib with slimy onions wasn't what I was hoping for. While the au just was tasty, I expected something more. Seemed like it was missing a spice.\\n\\nFrench fries were great and the chocolate shake was EXCELLENT. I'd go again in hopes I just picked a bad night, but it was pretty pricey, so if I'm a disappointed again, they're done.\",\n",
       " u\"I guess I'm supposed to hate this place; its a chain, its usually crowded, the juke boxes are stupid. \\n\\nBut, I feel comfortable there and I enjoy the food. \\n\\nWhat can I say? Its better than Denny's. I like it.\",\n",
       " u'Good service good food beautiful weather to enjoy outside =)',\n",
       " u'A heaping scoop of cold mashed potatoes slathered with LAME sauce is how I would classify this dinner!\\n\\nI\\'ve read some of the other reviews on this particular establishment, and will agree with the one that says that businesses sometimes have bad days.  It would appear that this business is having more than their fair share these days.\\n\\nThere were 5 of us, including one fairly easy to please 10 year old.  First it took the server the better part of a half an hour to acknowledge that we were sitting on the patio in high 80 degree weather with no beverages.... IN THE DESERT!!!  C\\'mon.  Once we ordered I just assumed that everything would remedy itself.  It was only the beginning.\\n\\nWhen the food was delivered (along with the appetizer that we ordered) it was cold and not even close to what we ordered.  Picture it... a \"hot\" roast beef open faced sandwich, which I asked for a substitution of french fries for the mashed potatoes (not a major request) and the bread was cold and soggy because it sat in the window forever.  When I asked to have it made to it\\'s menu specifications AKA HOT, they took it back and threw it in the microwave and returned the plate to me as I sent it back to the kitchen.  How do I know that?  Well, you know what happens when you put bread in the microwave?  It\\'s gets hard and stale, a texture that once you experience you won\\'t soon forget.\\n\\nWhen we told the waitress that \"tonight isn\\'t a good night for us here I guess\".  Her response was \"It is for me too\".  Server Rule #1 - NEVER MAKE YOUR PROBLEM, THEIR PROBLEM!\\n\\nEnter the \"Manager\".  I do have to give points for the manager standing in front of us and taking her lumps.  I have to take away points for never making an offer to take anything off the bill.  You have to remember that I sent my food back and declined an offer for anything else.\\n\\nIf any of the restaurant staff reads this review, please take one thing away from it... You can work wonders by L-I-S-T-E-N-I-N-G and NOT MAKING EXCUSES!!  If the kitchen truly was the problem, they needed to step it up!!  If the waitress couldn\\'t handle the number of people she was waiting on, you should have replaced her or reduced her section.  I only say this because we noted that she was waiting on a huge party of 15 people, us and several others (and I don\\'t think she was experienced enough to even handle two tables).\\n\\nReady for dessert?  One of the waitresses was wearing a cute black skirt uniform dress.  Apparently she was having issues with her shoes or socks because she bent over to readjust them.  I bet you know what\\'s coming next.... What\\'s rule #1 when wearing a skirt ladies??  Don\\'t bend over in your skirt when your standing three steps above the people below you, because they will surely see whatch-yo Mama gave ya!!\\n\\nIn closing, do I think this was meant to be four star dining? NO.  Do I think that we deserved as much attention as anyone else there tonight? ABSOLUTELY.  Did we catch them on a bad night?  PROBABLY.  Will I go back and give them a second and final opportunity to improve upon this bad experience?  YOU BETCHYA!!\\n\\nGood luck here, and I hope your experience is better than ours was.',\n",
       " u'Always am waited on right away and the food comes out fast. This place is ALWAYS open, so I give them props. I even came here and ate at 5am when I couldnt sleep and the servers were not grumpy at all like at other places. Decent food, cute atmosphere. They sometimes show old movies on a projector screen in the parking lot and you can bring your dog if you eat outside.',\n",
       " u\"Food - not so good.\\n\\nI've eaten here twice for breakfast.  The first time I got a basic eggs, potatoes, meat dish and it was okay.  The second time I got california eggs benedict - big mistake.  The Hollandaise sauce was disgusting, and did not look like Hollandaise.  It looked more like cheeze whiz.  I scraped it off.\\n\\nI wouldn't say run like the hills if you're hungry, but I also won't eat there again unless I have to.\",\n",
       " u'Great menu and even better drinks! What else can I say just go and see',\n",
       " u'Fulfills expectation of a diner. The reuben sandwich was pretty good. Onions rings were a little lukewarm but the fries were very fresh, hot and delicious. For a small kitchen, they really cranked out the food fast and the service was not bad.',\n",
       " u\"Regular 50's diner. The food is good and the service is usually good. Small place. Only neg is if your in a wheelchair- you're sitting outside.\",\n",
       " u\"Worst McD's in the world wide Franchise!!! I live down the road and they consistently serve old, soggy fries!  The workers consistently sound irritable and commonly get your order wrong.  I usually would not waste my time reviewing a McD's but after 10+ visits to this McD's I am thoroughly dissatisfied.  Do your self a favor and drive down the road to the next McD.  Especially if you want hot, fresh, crispy McDonald's Fries!\",\n",
       " u\"Wonderful Greek Food offered with Excellent Service in an authentic setting, unfortunately very overpriced.  Difficult to enjoy a proper meal for under $100 for two people.  We may be back, but only on special occasions.  We'd be regulars if prices were reasonable.\",\n",
       " u'Loved this place! I had the calamari and came with rice and eggplant slice. Very delicious and the waiter did a great job!',\n",
       " u\"There is a difference between authentic and antiquated and unfortunately this is the latter. The food was ok but spending HOURS on a weeknight waiting for food in an empty restaurant in the most uncomfortable chair I've ever sat in was not a pleasant experience.\",\n",
       " u\"All I can say is yuck. I expect a lot from chain/franchises. Maybe the food won't be the highest quality, but the service and cleanliness should be right on. And it should be fast.\\nI went here a couple of times and was dissapointed every single time. The last time I went, I got a bagel with cream cheese for take out. I got home and started eating it and, would you believe it, it tasted like cigarettes!! Clearly, whoever made it had just been smoking, came back inside, and made my food without washing their hands!!!! Respulsive, I didn't even bother to go back to complain.\\nI will never give Einsteins my business again.\\nLooking through Yelp, I see a ton of bad reviews about all of the Einsteins. You would think corporate would take these reviews from the general population into some serious consideration. We may not be official food critics, but we do know what is going on.\",\n",
       " u\"In the mornings, I like to stop off and get myself some coffee and a treat of some sort before I roll into work.  I stop here because its close to work.\\n\\nI can't say that I'm really a fan of Einstein's...they lack in so many areas, but I continue to go because I guess their just there, and its easy to stop in.\\n\\nI'm not all impressed with this location.  The service is slow, their coffee bar area is slow to be restocked and half the time I have to ask for refills on coffee creamer, and other times its just long lines at like 7 am due to the slow service.  Plus, their bagels are not all that great to begin with.  I usually stick with the muffins myself, since they are usually pretty good, and the prices are A-okay.\\n\\nOverall, its not that bad of a place, but Einstein's has become rather bland and boring over the years, leaving me desperate for better service, better bagels and a mostly generic feel.  blah.  I will say, at least this location has a decent amount of seating!\",\n",
       " u\"Like most Einstein locations, I'm unimpressed with the way the business is run.  The bagels aren't  bad, but they're not worth the aggravation it takes to obtain one.  The line was crazy long on a Wednesday morning at 8:30am, there already was a severe shortage in options because several bagels and pastries were already sold out, and after ordering you continue to wait in line just to pay.\\n\\nThere are some pluses.  This location has plenty of seating (however, most of it is outside on a shared patio with Starbucks and a sandwich shop).  It's a short walk from the Camelback automile, which makes it one of the best places to grab something to eat if you're getting your car serviced around breakfast or lunchtime.  It's also open until 5pm which is actually pretty late for an Einstein.\\n\\nJudging by the fact that I've reviewed three Einstein locations, and given all of them just two stars, I'm guess that most of the problems come down from the corporate level.  However, each location seems to always have a steady flow of customers, so why should they work to improve the massive flaws?\",\n",
       " u\"Love Einstein's! Great selection of bagels and also a great selection of cream cheese shmears. You can come in and experiment with all the combinations; different bagels, cream cheeses, get it toasted, not toasted, plain or all spiced up. Folks behind the counter are friendly. Get my order right ..yep.. every. single. time. Want to save money on your coffee while enjoying yummy bagel? Just bring your travel mug for discount price. Not an Einstein's mug? No problem! Heck, you could even bring in your Starbucks mug (from nextdoor) and refill it here for cheap. Deal! Great sitting area outside. Want to walk, jog, or bring the dog here on Saturday? Perfect spot for it. Sitting inside and forgot your newspaper? Everyone shares the 'community' paper around here. I have to give it 5 stars :-) Yup..Every time I venture to a new bagel spot I always come back to Einstein's.\",\n",
       " u'Jenny loves smiles!  And it shows!  First of all, the coffee was hot, and I mean hot!  But, let\\'s be honest, it is supposed to be!  The bagel was very good, perfectly toasted, and when I asked if I could order an extra side of veggie schmear, she said \"absolutely\"! (free of charge!)\\nThe customer service was excellent, the restaurant was clean, and Jenny-you are very good at your job,  it shows through all of your employees.  Keep up the great work!',\n",
       " u\"Einstein's is an okay chain.  It's not my favorite but in a pinch, it can hit the spot.  This location, however, leaves a lot to be desired.  I've stopped in multiple times due to the convenient location but I always leave disappointed.  \\n\\nThe food here is the standard Einstein's fare.  I'm not a real bagel fan but I have sampled a few of the breakfast sandwiches.  They were okay, nothing memorable.  I usually stop in for a coffee or a latte.\\n\\nThis last visit really made me mad.  I ordered a hot chai latte and ended up leaving with something else (never figured out what the drink was).  Unfortunately, I was a good ways down the road before the drink had cooled enough for me to take a sip.  Aaargh!\\n\\nWhat really annoys me about this location is the lack of customer service.  I've found that the folks working behind the counter are rather gruff and unfriendly. On this last visit, the young lady didn't greet me and refused to look me in the eye.  It's been a similar story with my previous visits.  The store seems to stay fairly busy in the morning hours.  I don't know if this contributes to the service problem or not.  Either way, I've made my final visit.  I can get a hot drink elsewhere.\",\n",
       " u\"I don't have bagels very often but decided to meet my brother today for coffee and a nosh.\\n\\nWe arrived at 11:30, both of us were starved.  He ordered a toasted plain with a schmear. (He's a food purist!) I grabbed a lox on pumpernickel with capers and an onion schmear, along with their house coffee.\\n\\nOur meal was delicious.  Einstein's is good for a quickly prepared snack.  It's not fancy but is well located and there are lots of great selections.  I like their coffee a lot more than many other retailers as well, so try to have some whenever I go.  I just wish they carried more sugar-free syrups.\\n\\nI have had their bagel dogs in the past and enjoyed them.  And, of course, the fall season brings pumpkin bagels and the transcendental pumpkin cream cheese.  I try to have at least one or two of those during that time!\\n\\nI recommend Einstein's for it's service and variety!\",\n",
       " u'company dose not care about getting rid of flies in restaurant.  It is awful. Service is not good.',\n",
       " u'Not quite as centrally located as I\\'d like (but, that\\'s just me), but a great place with warm, friendly & helpful people -- people who like people (OOPS, off topic song que) -- interesting and tasty menu items [I almost wrote \"tasty menu\", but I go for enough cheap jokes around here without stooping that low].  \\n\\nThe food is good.  The people are friendly & helpful. The prices are reasonable.  The location is just a bit Northeast of where my mind wanders for a casual place.\\n\\nI just spotted Tori B\\'s review, so I\\'ll definitely have to consider the brunch!',\n",
       " u'Nothing special. \\n\\nThe food, what little they give you, was decent. The chicken was very flavorful, the vegetables were ok.  Not worth what they charge for it.\\n\\nThe small portions, coupled with the  neo-country sound track make this a one time stop for me.',\n",
       " u'Phoenix City Grille knocked my socks off with some special treats they dazzled us with at a CMYE (Community Manager Yelp Event) and I recently returned with the generous buy-one-get-one voucher they sent us home with (it expires on the 30th, fellow Yelpers who haven\\'t redeemed theirs yet). \\n\\nAfter the delicious scallops at our Yelp event, you can guess what I had my heart set on -- hopeful that there would be a special, since they are not a regular menu offering. \\n\\nFortunately for me, there was a short rib and scallop special. It was accompanied by fried green beans. The sort rib was good. Definitely tender with a real hearty, rich, beefy flavor. There was only 1 scallop. It was a little tougher than the ones showcased at our event. \\n\\nTrying to minimize the calories, I asked for plain green beans instead. The kitchen sent out the fried which our server quickly noted and corrected, leaving the fried ones for my dinner partner to enjoy. Lacking any substantive willpower, I nibbled one or two and they were quite tasty. A light tempura coating combined with the cooking technique offered a unique, enjoyable flavor. \\n\\nMy \"plain\" green beans were dressed in olive oil with garlic, salt and pepper (just like I make at home). Still crisp, they were delicious! \\n\\nSo, I got my wish with the special, but the the regular menu challenges decision-making abilities with so many great options! \\n\\nMy friend got the beef tenderloin and it was, quite possibly, the best steak I\\'ve had in the Valley. It was fabulously tender (even cooked medium well) and perfectly seasoned. I look forward to ordering one for myself on a future visit. \\n\\nI had heard about the bread pudding from the CMYE reviews and so we splurged with dessert. It was phenomenal! Think the fluffiest, most custardy french toast flavor you\\'ve ever had! Thank goodness it was cut into two pieces -- better for a peaceful sharing. \\n\\nAnother tip from the CMYE, thanks to Don S., I tried the Brophy Clark Pinot Noir ($11/glass) and it was love at first sip! I liked it so much, I called Total Wine to see about buying a bottle for home and searched the vineyard\\'s website for where to buy a bottle in Arizona but didn\\'t get very far. I guess I\\'ll have to add that to the reasons to return to Phoenix City Grille!',\n",
       " u'PCG cannot fail to please. i have been twice now, once for a yelp event and once to use the coupon they gave me at said yelp event. Both times i was blown away by the delicious food i had here. \\nThe follow up visit i brought my best friend, the lovely Barbara G and we had an excellent time!\\nThe service is great, and i am especially fond of the waiter who took care of me both visits, gosh i wish i could remember his name...but without sounding...a little...too...glaad...not that there\\'s anything wrong with that! he was a very handsome man....but i was genuinely impressed that he remembered me from the yelp event, and both visits his serving skillz were right on par. kudos! \\nwhen we sat down and perused the menu I was still a little \"dazed and confused\" from my morning rituals *ahem* and everything on the menu sounded ridiculously good to me, it was getting so hard to make up my mind, i was floundering until my lovely friend Barbara suggested the bacon bleu cheese burger, a girl after my own heart!\\nWe then both ordered said burger, a coke for her and a pabst for myself. We gnoshed on those delicious burgers accompanied w/ garlic horseradish mashed potatoes ooooweee! Here was a dish that was so perfectly flavoured and well thought out and deceptively simple. without a shadow of doubt one of the best burgers i\\'ve had in phx. I would recommend PCG to any and all, and look forward to when i make my return.',\n",
       " u\"Matt and I dined here for our Christmas Eve dinner. Since this was the first time I didn't make the trip home to San Francisco for Christmas, I had absolutely no idea what to do with my Christmas Eve. Matt and I need plans! Therefore, after doing some investigative work on the internet as to what Arizonians can do in Phoenix on Christmas Eve, I came across PCG and their special menu for the holiday. Their prime rib and sea bass specials looked mouthwatering so I made reservations. In the end, this place did not disappoint!! I will unquestionably be back. \\n\\nI started out with a strong and tart pomegranate margarita that wasn't too sweet. I don't like it when margaritas are sugary so this one was perfect, and a great way to get my Christmas festivities started. \\n\\nFor my main course I opted to try the sea bass special. It came with almond crusted asparagus and some garlicky (and insanely buttery) rosemary mashed potatoes. How would I describe the entire meal? In one word, perfection! That sea bass was so fresh and delicious it practically swam right up to my plate. You can't really go wrong with asparagus but this wasn't just your regular vegetable. They coated the asparagus with a crunchy layer of almonds and it was soooooo tasty. And yeah, the mashed potatoes tasted like they had about 5 cubes of butter in them... but that's the best way to make em!\\n\\nI wish I had known about this place sooner because it really is such a delightful restaurant. The atmosphere isn't too lively but it isn't too dull. Tons of families, friends and large groups filled the interior so PCG really suits any age demographic. I loved the decorations that they had up for Christmas, and I highly recommend dining here for any holiday. They really do an all around excellent job at providing an awesome dining experience. \\n\\nWhen I was there I also noticed that they have a really nice bar with an even nicer happy hour... so once I get the chance, I'm going to head right back here and try it out! Everyone in AZ needs to know about this place. It's one of those solid classic restaurants you can go to for pretty much any occasion. 5 stars to PCG!\",\n",
       " u\"What can I say about PCG? I love it. There's something for everyone here. My recommendations are:\\n\\n-anything they have on special\\n-pot roast\\n-cedar plank salmon\\n-tortilla soup if they have it\\n-wedge salad\\n-chili\\n\\nAlso...if you drink, make sure to try one of their Moscow Mules.\",\n",
       " u\"Service is excellent but I tried the corn cakes that everyone is raving about and I just don't get it. They are like pancakes, but with some veggies between them, kind of like an omelette... and then there's some pico de gallo thrown in (that was good) and served with syrup. Just my personal preference, I guess, all of those flavors didn't blend well for my taste. However, the bloody Mary was tasty and at $4 is a steal on a Sunday morning! My companions had the crab cake benedict and the bread pudding french toast (more like a dessert than a breakfast), both were excellent.\",\n",
       " u'To start of the new year, we were in Phoenix. My cousin recommended this place and he was able to make reservations via Open Table for the 6 of us. Our reservations were for 7pm, but they were that packed that we didn\\'t get seated until around 7:30. It\\'s a cozy lil place and when we finally did get seated we sat in the \"governor\\'s corner.\"\\n\\nThey had a lot of drink specials which I would have loved to try, but I was feeling under the weather. I ended up ordering the Cedar Planked Salmon. I made my husband get the special for the night,  ribeye surf and turf (basically shrimp, sausage and scallops on a stick as the surf part). My salmon was a slightly over cooked and I wasn\\'t a fan of the horseradish potatoes, but I ended up trading the potatoes with my husband\\'s potatoes which were so much better. =) He seemed like he enjoyed his meal and he ended up eating the rest of mine too. (That\\'s what husband\\'s are good for ;)) In any case, I loved the atmosphere and the company. We ended up getting two free desserts with the kitchen being backed up and the wait for the table. We ended up with the croissant bread pudding and the warm chocolate torte. Both were delicious, but the warm chocolate torte was my favorite. \\n\\nOverall, service was good especially for a busy night and food was decent. I would definitely want to come back to try some drink specials and more desserts. =)',\n",

Back came the most frosty delicious Belvedere vodka tonic. Perf. The lovely, as prefers, mans up to the filet. And is always happy, sipping his pinot alongside.. \\n\\nI just wanted to say, yum.

I recently revisited after a brief hiatus and discovered, to my delight, their Wedge salad that I donned with beef tenderloin. It easily disappeared in record time. I only stopped to take sips of my filthy vodka martini.\\n\\nI am always reminded that this place can fit any occasion, from a romantic dinner to a night out with friends.

As we walked in the door we were greeted with a quality aroma that you just don't get from a typical grill. All we knew is that we had to try the ribs and we were glad we did! I had the crusted fish and it was fantastic! The menu had many different price options and that was nice too because sometimes you just want a burger! I think another reason why we will come back is because I saw many gluten free items on the menu. We have a son with Celiac so finding a safe place to feed him is priceless! Also love the combustible to go box!\",\n",
       " u'The taco appetizers were amazing!  We loved everything!  Topped it off with pumpkin cheesecake....amazimg!',\n",
       " u'Have only eaten lunch here, and the sandwiches are very good.  Not your plain, average run-of the mill sandwiches, either.  Healthy portions and excellent sides.',\n",
       " u'Yep another 4 stars award goes to the ducky. \\n\\nAgain, thank you yelp for introducing me to this place where everything is oh so calm and content all the time.\\n\\nThe cheese plate will leave you speechless along with a great vino.',\n",
       " u'Duck and Decanter is one of those places where while eating your meal, you suddenly think, \"Wait. Am I still in Phoenix?\" \\n\\nThis place is SO unlike anything else in midtown Phoenix that going there for the atmosphere is half the pleasure. It\\'s part sandwich shop, part eclectic boutique, part wine cellar, part loft. And some other things thrown in too. \\n\\nTucked away in a corner of a generic strip mall the place looks like someone\\'s house from the 70\\'s. Hard to describe. Once you enter there is a counter where you place your order with a little salad case, a cheese case, and a dessert case. Once you get your sandwich (or salad), you can either sit outside on the patio or take the stairs up to the upper dining area. Or sit on the upper deck outside patio. \\n\\nAnd yeah, the sandwiches can get a bit pricey but like I said, half the fun of the place is the atmosphere. I\\'ve always enjoyed my sandwich. It\\'s not like I\\'m paying for something I don\\'t like. The breads and the \\'fixin\\'s\\' have always been fresh and full of flavor. \\n\\nGo get a sandwich, do a little browsing, relax, and take in some people watching. \\n\\nAnd if you can figure out what city the place reminds you of, please let me know. Cause it\\'s not Phoenix, for sure.',\n",
       " u'I must say I can\\'t believe I have not yet written a review on The Duck yet. As literally one of my favorite places in town one would think it would be at the top of my to do list. Maybe it is my secret desire to keep it a secret, as best as I can, so that it does not turn into a zoo everyday and I can\\'t get my yummy sammies. \\n\\nIt is also extremely surprising to me that some have gone to lengths of posting a negative review of The Duck. It seems that in those cases they are wanting The Duck to be something it\\'s clearly not; a mainstream-mass production-delivary running-squeeky clean-just-like-every-there kinda place. If that\\'s what you are looking for then I would suggest going to AJ\\'s, they might be a better fit for you.\\n\\nDuck and Decanter has been around for longer than I have been around. They have won award after award for the best sandwich in town. I am surprised Kanye hasn\\'t busted in on a subway commercial and told Jared that he would let him finish, but Duck and Decanter has the best stuff EVER! It has a homey feel, that makes you almost say (as Jeff L. put it) \"Am I still in Phoenix?\" \\n\\nThey have daily soups and special sandwiches. Their cheese is out of this world, the best provolone I have ever had for sure. They slice all their meat in house and very thin, perfect! I would tell you what sammy is my favorite, but that list would go on way too long. Turkey on a croissant, bree with roasted red peppers and prosciutto, garlic chicken salad, BLT.... \\n\\nThe Duck is the perfect spot to have lunch out on the patio on a sunny Saturday or Sunday. They have a musician playing music most of the time and sometimes even have cute little farmers markets and art fests. It is perfectly tucked back in the shopping center with Sports Authority shielding you from the hustle and bustle. There is a fun grass area for pets and children to run around on. They also have some great knickknack shopping available to pa-ruse while you wait for your food. They have all kinds of coffee, tea, dishware, cookware, marinades, candy, drinks, wind chimes, magnets, jewelry, specialty gifts, and so on and so on. You can also call ahead and reorder to avoid the sometimes very long line. \\n\\nHave fun!',\n",
       " u\"I really love the duck sandwich at their deli which I never had before.  The wine bar is treat too for washing down your food and plenty of outdoor seating for a group meet.  The rest of the place is kind of confusing in terms of the varying stuff that they have for sale. I'm not sure how it blends in with the deli but then again, this is an opportunity to try out a new place.\",\n",
       " u'Have enjoyed this spot for years but what has happened to Camelback store? Sandwiches and friendly staff still good as ever but during two-three visits over past year, once-inviting patio has degenerated into a dirty, neglected eyesore full of dead leaves from nearby trees, dusty unbussed tables and an inoperative misting system. A real turn-off, especially since you have to walk through patio to enter, even to pick up to-go orders.',\n",
       " u'\"The Duck\" has been a regular haunt for me as long as I can remember. Even as a child I loved going to the Duck & Decanter. The sandwiches are absolutely delish as well as original. If you\\'re not feeling adventurous though, you can always creat your own favorite. The cheese selection is decent and the cheese plates are always generous. In the wine room, you will find an excellent selection wines and beers, and an always helpful and knowledgeable staff member should you, like myself, need help making a choice. The patio is a wonderful place to spend an afternoon, especially when there is live music and fabulous weather. (Plus dogs are welcome on the patio.) Family owned and operated, the Duck is a valley favorite as well as my favorite!',\n",
       " u\"After 14 years in the valley we finally made it to The Duck!  What a wonderful surprise!  Friendly staff, great  foods and an adorable shop plus a wine bar and patio for added bonus!  \\n\\nCouldn't possibly look at everything they have to offer in the short wait for our food, but will definately make another trip here soon!  Many many many products from all over the world along with over 60 International cheeses to choose from!  Great choices in salads and sandwiches along with anything you want to drink or take it with you!  This place is exceptional and can be very overwhelming on your first visit, but you can easily change around anything you want from the bread to the condiments and add any kind of cheese you could possibly think of!  \\n\\nYes it is a little odd to get to the first time and yes there is a parking lot next to this place, but it has been there for over 35 years - so I'm betting GNC, Sports Authority or Einsteins (ugh - the worst!) was even a thought when this place was built, besides after you enter their lovely patio you completely forget about all of that!  It's better than I ever imagined and we are both ready to go back and try more!\\n\\nWe can't believe it's taken us this long to visit this place and now we are sorry we waited, what a great find!  If you live in the valley you owe it to yourself to try The Duck!  As for the people who say expensive - I don't know where they are eating but this is very reasonable, especially for this quality of food!\\n\\nCheese lovers delight!!!\",\n",
       " u\"10 Reasons why I love thee: \\n\\n1. Specifically, the Where's the Beef? Vegetarian sandwich. Fresh veggies like avocado, sprouts, lettuce, swiss and more. Good bread, not dry, not stale, just plain good bread. Plus full of flavor! And I'm not even a vegetarian.\\n\\n2.   Alcohol with my sandwich, what a great thing to pair up and a huge variety at their wine bar\\n\\n3. Side options, so many to choose from and not just the normal potato salad or pasta salad. They have those too, but sides like cottage cheese with herbs, southwestern salad, egg salad and more\\n\\n4. Bread, meat, spreads and cheese selections too - I haven't tried all of them, but they all look delicious\\n\\n5. The gift store... I'm always looking for a place to bring out of town visitors and this will be one of them. Its an airy building with cute items and some would be useful around the house too\\n\\n6. All of the seating options, upstairs, downstairs, in the wine bar area, outside with live music, even midway on the stairs\\n\\n7. Friendly service from the people taking our food order to the bartender taking our drinks\\n\\n8. Live music in the courtyard area, such peaceful music that is not blaring loud. I can hear myself talk and enjoy the music too\\n\\n9. That its next to Copenhagen Furniture. Yeah... most wouldn't care, but give me a break, I'm looking for furniture.\\n\\n10. Half size options. I still take half of my meal home, but at least I'm not eating multiple meals of it.  \\n\\nI haven't tried the coffee or their breakfast, but I'm sure its good too. I know this place has been around for a long time and I have no idea what it tasted like before, but I like what it is now. I love this place just the way it is.\",\n",
       " u'This is by far the best place in Phoenix for an afternoon with family and friends for sandwiches. Sit outside on a beautiful fall or spring afternoon and sometimes you can catch some live music.\\nThey also have a nice wine bar with a good selection by the bottle or glass. The Duck offers spices, cookbooks, and unique gifts for last minute shopping.\\nI have been coming to the Duck for over 20 years and highly recommend it. Watch out for the weekly lunch rush though. It gets extremely busy and problematic if you have somewhere to be.',\n",
       " u'This place is great. It was my first time coming here and I didn\\'t really know what to expect coming in after looking at their website and reading other yelp reviews. What stuck out most to me was how quiet and tranquil it was. It wasn\\'t pretentious, or a hassle with them wanting you to buy anything, or otherwise stressful or anything like that. It\\'s a genuine hide away that gave me flashbacks of having lunch on my front lawn in the house I grew up in in western Oregon. Lush grass, big and plenty deciduous trees to provide plenty of shade and make that cool sound when a breeze comes through. It is very simple and tranquil to dine at. It also reminds me a lot of A.J.\\'s minus the grocery store and just offering quality coffee, wine, beer, sandwiches and sweets/desserts in a pleasant and classy atmosphere.\\n\\nI got their special. So for Wednesday it was the \"Healthy Humpday\" which is half of a generously portioned ham sandwich, as well as a generous helping of salad also with a dill pickle on the side and a taffy in a brown paper bag. Totaling a little over $4.50. Then I made my way over to the bar area and got a 12oz craft beer for their happy hour special of $3.00. So I basically got a generous quality lunch that left me stuffed and satisfied for $8.41 total. I was very impressed with everything and very much look forward to going back and eating there again.\\n\\nI feel like it should be closer to 4.5 stars, but since that\\'s not an option, and that 4 is simply just too low for me, 5 stars it is then.',\n",
       " u'Great lunch! Pretty darn good sandwiches! Gift shop, big bags of chips, and a great deli counter selection! They have a wine cellar with a great selection (not a HUGE selection) of hand picked great wine. Seating is outdoor, indoor, and upstairs in a little loft.  It is a casual place and a Phoenix local staple.',\n",
       " u\"This place is unlike any other. First of all, the name is unusual. The restaurant is tucked away and has trees surrounding the building. It almost feels like you're away from Arizona. The place is set up like a deli but also like a small store and a coffee bar and an art gallery and a patio space...super unique. I love the selection of foods and beverages. Ordering is simple (that is when you know what you want) and you have a chance to browse through the aisles as you wait for your order. They also have a loft space upstairs to enjoy your food but there's seating downstairs and outside on multiple patios. Perfect place for a weekday lunch or a brunch with your friends.\",\n",
       " u\"Food was good but won't be going there again. My friend and I had our 3 little kids with us (two of them only a year old). The babies were a bit fussy but not being out of control, and the manager came to us and told us we needed to quiet down. I was very offended seeing that the babies are only 1 year old, obviously children that age are hard to tell to be quiet. I take my kids out to eat all the time and have never had this issue at a restaurant, not pleased with how we were treated.\",\n",
       " u\"Loved this place! My husband and I went there for lunch on his very first Father's Day and it was great! I had an avocado sandwich with bacon and pepper harvarti added, he had The Duckling. Both sandwiches were delicious--fresh, crisp, and flavorful. The seating area outside was lovely, and with the misters, even a mid day lunch in June was comfortable. We also shared the potato bacon soup, which was delicious and satisfying. We liked the shop inside and had fun looking at everything and smelling the different teas and coffees sold there. I also really liked how they were pet friendly with biscuits and water bowls outside. We cannot wait to go back!\",\n",
       " u'Hzappy Paczki Dzay Evzerzybodyzy!!!!\\n\\nSo, if you\\'re from one of the cities back east with a large Polish population (like Chicago), Paczkis are pretty much a staple for Fat Tuesday.  For those of you unfamiliar, it\\'s pretty much a filled donut, but they\\'re really good, and made even more special because you can only ever get them 1 day a year.  \\n\\nI was told on good authority that Europa is *the* place to go in the valley for real Polish fare, and it certainly didn\\'t disappoint.  They had a whole case of authentic looking Polish baked things like Paczkis and Kolachkis and other things I can\\'t spell or pronounce, but also have lots of Ks, Zs and Is in their names.  From what I saw, the paczkis they had were:  raspberry, prune, cherry & cream cheese, apple, custard, strawberry & probably a few more I\\'m forgetting. \\n\\nThey also had a little Polish deli with more food I won\\'t even attempt to spell, but it certainly seemed authentic.  Lots of sausages and meats and things.   \\n\\nAlso, even the people that worked there were authentically Polish!  Well, I\\'m assuming so, at least.  They were white and spoke with accents I couldn\\'t understand, but reminded me of the northwest side of Chicago.  \\n\\nGo forth and enjoy the fatty deliciousness that is the Paczki before you have to do the whole \"Lent\" thing, if that\\'s the sort of thing you\\'re into.  If not, enjoy it without having to do any of that pesky fasting.',\n",
       " u\"I had to stop by during lunch to see what this place was about. They had 4 or 5 tables inside and 2 tables outside.  A large counter filled with different pastries/danishes/muffins/cookies/cakes/pies.  Another counter filled with different sandwich meats. I didn't order any sandwiches since I had ate, but still wanted a dessert to keep me through the day.  I wanted the Napoleon, but it was too big to finish.  So I had ordered a cheese danish instead.  The cheese danish was big for $1.60.  They do make their own breads. However at 1:30PM, there wasn't too much left.  They also sell European food items and goods.  I like to go back to try their polish plates, stuffed cabbage, and pierogi.\",\n",
       " u\"It's places like this that make me thankful for Yelp!  Being from out of town, my friends and I were looking for a quick breakfast stop to grab some baked goods and coffee.  This place popped up on Yelp and just as described it was awesome!  We got several different danishes, a cinnamon roll and sticky bun.  All were delicious and still HOT!  \\n\\nThe coffee was excellent too!  They had a hawaiian hazelnut coffee that day that had a coconut flavor to it and was delicious!\\n\\nBottom line: stop by for some delicious baked goods and get here early for hot fresh out of the oven yumminess!\",\n",
       " u\"This place is (pardon my 90's slang) off da hook! They have a variety of Polish (and other European) treats! I'd love to try it all even though I have no idea what is in it. The workers are very, very nice and happy to answer any questions. It's a refreshing menu change from my usual donut places! Though I still order pastries, including awesome donut-esque things filled with jam. Yum!\\nThey also sell imported foods, so if you're looking for a specific ingredient to make a fun European dish they may have it here!\",\n",
       " u\"This place had a hard time keeping up with the modest lunch crowd when I was there.   There were 3 buffet items that were totally out.  Not good since there were only a limited number of items to begin with.\\n\\nI thought the taste was off, not my type of Indian food. No spice and no heat. Blah.\\n\\nCome on, it''s a buffet and it's lunch.  Nobody has time to wait around for a piece of tandoori chicken.  Buh bye.\",\n",
       " u\"I truly love Indian food and I wanted to like this place more, but I ultimately couldn't. I wound up at the lunch buffet and didn't think too much of it. The dishes at the buffet really lacked the oomph that I am so used to at Indian restaurants, and unless the pot was personally stirred, some of the dishes were room temperature. As far as pricing, it wasn't too bad; it was just around $10. \\n\\nAfter reading other reviews (Mainly Lisa O's) I would consider trying this place after the buffet is put away. But until then, I'll probably just be staying away.\",\n",
       " u\"Recently got take out (chicken kadai and onion kulcha) and was a little disappointed. The meat was a bit fatty which is not OK!!! And, while this is supposed to be a spicier dish, which I would normally love, I found it to be spicy but not entirely flavorful. The onion kulcha was fine. Considering it's proximity to my apartment I may check it out again (perhaps stay away from the meat)?\",\n",
       " u\"Flavors is easily my favorite Indian restaurant in the Valley. With friendly wait staff, good prices and fantastic food you can't go wrong. Don't be fooled by it's humble exterior; it's the food you're there to enjoy. I prefer to skip the buffet as I like my food XXXX-Indian-hot, but I have never been disappointed at dinner. In fact, the staff recognize me and my daughter and often ask if we'll have our regular, even if it's been months since our last visit. \\nMy absolute favorite is the lamb vindaloo while my husband has chicken korma and my daughter goes for the chicken tikka masala and a mango lassi. Don't forget the rice pudding (kheer) for dessert. You won't be disappointed!!!\",\n",
       " u\"At first glance, I almost turned around and got back into my car. It was in a dark stripmall, everything in that stripmall was closed, etc. The husband and I walked in to an almost empty restaurant, again I almost ran. I'm so glad I didn't. To put it simply...I adored this place! The service was great (not overly attentive but didn't ignore us), the decour was great and more importantly the food was great! I had the lamb Marsala (mild) and found it delicious. My husband enjoyed his meal too. This place is definately on our list of places to go.\",\n",
       " u\"Great dinner and reasonable prices. Server gave us lots of attention even though the place was packed. We've come here several times and also been happy. Glad we live close.\",\n",
       " u'Perfect authentic food. Generous portions. Relaxing atmosphere. Just beautiful! Great  service. I want to try everything on the menu. Just go!',\n",
       " u\"I worked near there a couple years ago and would blindly walk in there on my lunch breaks over and over, ignorantly forgetting how mediocre the food was.  But I recently saw a Stixx has opening near there, so I don't even know if they are still in business...\",\n",
       " u\"I only purchased some hoggie rolls at this place but the bread quality was fantastic.  I'll be back to by some more yummy goodies at this place.\",\n",
       " u\"Delicious and family owned!\\n\\nI've been to Niccoli's only twice and the first time I went the owners made me feel like part of their family. After reading and watching a video about this little place I decided to give their desserts a try, boy were they good. They BEST cannoli that I've ever had the amazing wedding cookies. \\n\\nThe second time I went I gave one of their sandwiches a try. They were delicious!!! Again, everyone makes you feel so welcome and like you're part of the family. :)\",\n",
       " u\"If the food wasn't good, I'd still be back, since the service is fantastic. \\n\\nBut...the food is awesome. \\n\\nGet the cannolis.\",\n",
       " u'Peanut.\\nBuster.\\nParfait.\\nThe.\\nEnd.',\n",
       " u\"I LOVE the food here.\\nLOVE\\n\\nIt's an offtrack race horse betting bar, with cheap drinks and happy hour specials.  However, I regard myself as somewhat of a foodie, and I LOVE the food here!!\\n\\nTheir ahi tuna salad is sooooooo good and cheap!\\nTheir beef stroganoff is awesome\\nTheir grilled cheese and tomato soup is great!\\n\\nTry the food, you won't be sorry.\",\n",
       " u\"This is one of my favorite bars, its a cool relaxed environment. It has a great daily happy hour and reverse happy hour.  I have taken many friends and business clients, they have all wanted to go back.  Great food and drinks.  The wings in the Armadillo gold sauce can be voted Phoenix Best.  Their potato skins are the best I've had (when they don't come out a little burned I must admit).  Can you say Fried Pickles!  Give it a shot, if you like pickles you will love the Fried Pickles.  If you get the burger, you need to get the onion rings!!\",\n",
       " u\"Cheap Happy hour specails, Great service, and pool Table... I'm misty eyed allready...\\n\\nhopeing it would just get better from there... but little power for laptop meetings... Food just OK... and so is this place just OK...\",\n",
       " u'Upon first impressions, not that impressed. After a few minutes, I\\'m in love. The bartneders qere amazing, hooking it up with much needed shots and a free beer when he forgot to change the keg. The bartenders love to joke around and it seems like there are a lot of regulars. Always a good sign...\\n\\nI would give this place five stars if I had the food, they have tomato soup. Alas, I was out with the biggest tool in N Scottsdale and apparenty I didn\\'t deserve a meal with this horrible \"date\" because I wanted to leave so I could watch It\\'s Always Sunny. Best decision of my life!\\n\\nAlso, a warning to all Armadillo employees, I may attempt to steal that big red chest in the Women\\'s bathroom. It may take a few attempts, and I may get arrested, but I have to have it!',\n",
       " u\"I love this bar! The bartenders are awesome a lot of regulars here and I can see why it's easy to become one everyone is really nice. I went there with my roommate and about three times and they welcome us like we've been going for years.As far as the food I've really only had the fried pickles which are amazing! They have great drink specials and reverse happy hour. I haven't made it to happy hour yet because I'm scared I will stay there until close.The inside is nothing fancy but, enough bar games to keep you entertained.\",\n",
       " u\"Jason B. and I decided to try this place on Saturday night. I looked at the menu online and though the food sounded really interesting.\\n\\nWe started with the Artichoke Croquettes, and the Calamari as well. We were disappointed in the Artichoke Croquettes, you get 4 half Artichokes fried with alternating Marinara and this white sauce. The only thing that was good about this dish was the white sauce, which we used to dip the Calamari in. The Calamari was your average calamari, nothing special! \\n\\nI ordered a the 19th Street Burger, which was cooked perfectly and came with a spicy sauce, not sure if the sauce was for the Onion Rings, but it was great of the Burger.\\n\\nNot sure I will be rushing back to the Armadillo Grill, but I wouldn't say no to going back again!\",\n",
       " u'fun happy hour place! good appetizer selection! great beers! funny bartenders!',\n",
       " u\"While the ambiance here is definitely nothing worth writing home about, you can't beat the reverse happy hour. $3.50 food items (hummus, mozzarella sticks, etc) bring me back from time to time. They also have some drink specials, including theme nights where you can get cheap margaritas, etc. Worth going at least once.\",\n",
       " u\"First time at this place and it was really nice, the sign kind of sneeks up on you if your going west on Camelback , but it's all good you can get in the back way.. Prices were great and the food was really good.. Oh and they have off track betting to boot.. The staff was really friendly as well.. It was a good chioce.. \\n\\nI will go back..\",\n",
       " u\"Right down the street from maizies this is a great place to end your Monday night. I haven't experienced the food because I was always stuffed after the burger ar Maizies. But this is a great Monday spot because you don't pay for pool!\\n\\nThere are a lot of locals who frequent here, I would guess more on Monday. That's very much a guess because its the only day I went! You know what happens when you assume though...\\n\\nAnyhow! It's very low key with great prices on drinks! Bar tenders are happy to give up suggestions when you're ready for something new. This is nice when you're as indecisive as myself.\\n\\nThey have loads of games besides pool. Darts, touch screen, etc. You will NOT be bored! (:  The patio is a tad small and on a main road, but that's ok I was always too busy inside on the games to notice.\\n\\n\\nI like this place because the people and bar remind me of the east coast in a way. I will be returning!\",\n",
       " u'We went into Armadillo Grill for lunch and to watch football. I was very impressed with the atmosphere and food. We had drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Everything was phenomenal. We loved the mozzarella bites. This is one of the few bars I have been to that also has horse racing. Really good time!',\n",
       " u\"I eat here Almost daily ! The staff is exceptional and they always make me feel welcome ! And are very personable which I love ! The ranch dressing is the best ever and the burgers and hot wings and chimichanga and also the calamari are all to die for !!! I love the iced tea as well ! Best ever ! This is my favorite spot to go period and I've tried a lot of places.\",\n",
       " u\"I can't believe I have ignored NYPD Pizza for the past few years. I think I subconsciously thought I was going to get arrested or something.  I must have walked/driven past this place at least 200 times without a second thought of going in until last week. The joke is on me.\\n\\nTaking the sister, her hubby and the kiddies for dinner in Central Phoenix and finding a restaurant we would all like was a challenge and thanks to Oregano's having a 2 hour Saturday night wait - which is par for the course - we ended up here.  NYPD Pizza and a 20 minute wait?  We're sold.  Another must was a TV for the NFL playoffs which they showed in the small bar area. As for the interior, it very much felt like a neighborhood cafe with the interior brick facade and stringed lights criss-crossing the room.\\n\\nWell, NYPD Pizza delivered and then some.  They liked their pizza, minestrone and garlic bread knot thingies.  The girls got kids sized spaghetti and meatball, a coloring paper menu and crayons.  I needed to overload on carbs for a big race the next day so I ordered pasta.  My baked ziti with sausage was absolutely delicious.  Having had that same dish at Oregano's, it is much better than what they serve.  If you're not a fan of cheese you probably won't like the ziti at NYPD.  But since I love cheese, it hits the spot.\\n\\nI wouldn't have been able to tell the difference in water in the taste of their dough, but apparently the fact that they import their water from Brooklyn is a big deal.  Kinda pretentious if you ask me, but hey, I like the extra effort and I liked the fact that I did not get arrested.\",\n",
       " u\"Do you know pizza?  Or is pizza an acquaintance to you? \\n\\nIs pizza a long-term relationship, or is it the Betty that you picked up at Dos Gringos on a Friday afternoon?\\n\\nIf you are truly a student of pizza, you know this:  it's all about the water stupid.  It really shouldn't be a secret why za in NY and C-town is so good.\\n\\nHence, apply this rationale and you know the secret to NYPD.  Great za in Phoenix, AZ???  You bet!\\n\\nPizza starts with the crust.  Without great crust, you can't have great za.  But...if you make your crust with the exact mineral content of water from Yonkers, NY....you have a great crust!\\n\\nTop it off with a spicy (not sweet) sauce, and moz that is of good quality and melt, and abracadabra....there it is.\\n\\nWay to go NYPD...pride in za making....and real ovens too!  Conveyor belt pizza is crapola, meant for California.\\n\\nI give it my 2nd highest 'sausage and pepperoni' rating, from the NY Pizza Guy.\",\n",
       " u\"My girlfriend and I had a mean craving for pizza and wings after browsing the Phoenix Zoo...We thought this place was Streets of New York, till we got there and it was a NYPD (did I mention I don't like police). lol So we said screw it and decided to check it out anyway. When we got there the host seemed annoyed and practically threw our menus on the table. He Sucked! \\n\\nWe ordered the Hell's Kitchen wings and the Philly Cheese steak pizza. First off the Wings were fantastic, although not as spicy as we anticipated. The wings came with sliced jalape\\xf1os scattered over the top of them, but it was just a psychological thing to make you think they're spicier. The Philly pizza was sub par. It was low on cheese and some what under cooked. There was still water from the meat running of the sides, basically making the crust soggy. \\n\\nOur waiter was very generous, unfortunately I forgot her name. She changed my perspective of the service.  For some strange reason, the host was still giving me the stink eye...I think he liked my girlfriend or something or may be just hated his job. lol    \\n\\nOverall, I would have preferred hitting up Streets of New York! By the way did I mention I don't like police. Except a friend of mine who just graduated the academy. Congratulations! Now keep me safe from other police.\",\n",
       " u'This pizza has to be one of the best in the valley. I ordered a 5 topping 18\" for about $25, well worth it. My brother just had his wisdom teeth pulled two days ago and has been eating oatmeal and pudding for these past two days. I holla lets do some NYPD for lunch! my brother jumps up with this smile on his face, so we head out. Fresh ingredients, good service, well worth it.',\n",
       " u\"The pizza is really good here! Good ingredients, lots of cheese and crispy crust. I won't say it's like NY pizza, but it's very tasty in its own way.\\n\\nFriendly service and charming ambiance, with lots of Frank Sinatra music, and subway-esque signage. Only thing I haven't liked here is the lemonade, it's made from a mix, and the temperature in the restaurant is always freezing.\",\n",
       " u'Great food, great staff and i can bring my dog.',\n",
       " u\"As far as take out goes, this is true NYC style pizza.  I had two slices of the cheese for lunch today, and I can't wait to eat it again!!!\",\n",
       " u'Ahh the joys of living in Phoenix.  The cheery voice taking my order let me know about the 1-1:15 hour delivery wait.  I just had to try something different than Dominos.  Guess what?  Dominos is actually better and $10 less than my overpriced $32 pizza/meatball sandwich meal.  This has solidified my opinion that the best pizza in Phoenix is still Spinatos.  \\n\\nThe NYPD meatballs had a taste that could not be recognized; if these are meatballs, then they should be renamed spicy bready dough balls.  The pizza was a little warm when I got it and certainly not thin crust.  So many pizza places lie about \"thin crust\" that the next time I\\'m going to ask how thin?\\n\\nThe cheesecake was actually the best part of it; next time, skip the pizza and just order dessert for lunch!',\n",
       " u'Great place! Great pizza, great prices, and great fast and friendly service...',\n",
       " u\"I have lived in Phoenix since 1985 and have been searching for the perfect pizza.  Finally found it.\\nThe Sicialian is excellent.  I remember walking down the streets in the Big Apple and going up to a pizza parlor with window service and buying a slice of the Sicilian pizza pie and continuing down 42nd St while devouring it.   Well NYPD did not dissappoint me.  One bite and I was hooked.  I no longer have to wander from pizza joint to pizza joint looking for the taste I have so long craved.  \\nNow if I could just find a pizza like the Vinnie Pie I used to buy at Vinnies on Ardmore Blvd back in Pittsburgh.\\nWell I guess you can't have it all though so I will just stick with what I have found at NYPD.\",\n",
       " u\"The pizza here is solid, living in New York before, I have a reference point.  I love the oil that drips down in the middle of the pizza when it's folded upwards...Yummmmmm! That's surely the money marker and that's why I keep coming back. Service is always on point, you can always expect a smile, and greeting each time you come here. Everyone seems like they like their job here. The house salad is pretty basic,  but when you add the homemade Balsamic dressing, it is soon good. I have not tried anything else on the menu,  but I am certainly open and anticipating. Will Def go back, and if you love good pizza...then this is your spot. They do have other locations in the valley,  so check it out\",\n",
       " u\"Oh NYPD Pizza. You seriously disappointed me. \\n\\nMy husband and I stopped in on Saturday around 1pm. We were seated quickly since the restaurant wasn't busy but it took us 15 minutes for a waiter to come by. FIFTEEN minutes. A different waiter dropped off two waters when we sat down, but other than that - no one even acknowledged us. We had to stop another waitress and ask who are waiter was - and she seemed super confused. \\n\\nFinally Connor rolls around. Doesn't apologize for the wait - just seems nonchalant about taking our order. \\n\\nWe split the chopped salad and had a few slices of pizza. The pizza was fine but don't bother with the chopped salad - not worth $10 at all. I think we counted a grand total of 4 tiny pieces of sun dried tomatoes and 8 quarter pieces of cucumber. \\n\\nWe were never checked on during our dining experience until my husband was taking the last bite of pizza crust, Connor asked us how was the food. Really? Water was never refilled and extra napkins never appeared. \\n\\nWe won't be coming back.\",\n",
       " u\"forget what you know about fine italian dining. the dining at Giuseppe's is neither fine, expensive, or classy. it's a black and white tiled mecca of italian food, nestled comfortably in the same strip mall as a cellular reseller and a blockbuster. go anytime, and order anything. if you see a dude alone at a table getting drunk on red wine, that's the owner. the first time we went we cut him off for a parking spot outside. PARTY FOUL. it's BYOB, so make sure you stop at sprouts next door and get a bottle or five of whatever they have on sale.\",\n",
       " u'I try not to throw around 5-stars out like gang signs, because I really want to reserve the primo ratings for places that really knock my socks off. But, Giuseppe\\'s is quite deserving of the highest rating because it really is a gem of a place. \\n\\nVoted New Times Best of Phoenix Neighborhood Italian (2003), veal (2004) and BYOB (2005), Giuseppe\\'s certainly has earned such accolades. However, in all fairness, I must say I do not live in the neighborhood nor did I have the veal. But, I\\'ll most definitely be trying the veal. And since I went with Robert M, you should know that BYOB is a given. Well, honestly, since I showed up it\\'s almost certain that I\\'m carrying some form of alcohol on my person. \\n\\nAfter watching a decidedly emotionally-charged movie at Camelview (The Boy in the Striped Pajamas, an amazing must-see even though a key element in the film is grossly misleading--PM me if you\\'ve seen it and I\\'ll share) Robert M and I needed to do something to appreciate the goodness in life so we decided to devirginize ourselves of the Giuseppe\\'s experience. It was about 4:45 p.m. on a Saturday and we were seated immediately. Tucked into a strip mall, it immediately reminded us of the set-up of Pizza A Metro. After reviewing the menu, Robert walked over to Sprouts for wine and we ordered three bruschetta (slow-cooked pork ribs with tomato & melted mozzarella, pesto &fresh tomato and chevre & marinated sun-dried tomatoes) that were all extremely delicious. The bread remained firm and not soggy, yet not so hard that it hurt your teeth or cut the roof of your mouth. We also split the lasagna which was made with fresh pasta and plated with the most divine \"gravy\" [for all the Italians, although I\\'m Irish] that we\\'ve ever tasted. So *smooth* and not bitter or acidic or sweet or anything less than heavenly. If I could bathe in this, I would. But, since I\\'m not a splosher... :blush: \\n\\nIf only I wouldn\\'t have eaten so much popcorn in the hour before going to Giuseppe\\'s, I would have indulged in so much more. But, alas, I have found a reason to take this Avenue kid back to the Streets: Giuseppe\\'s.',\n",
       " u\"After hearing my sister who lives in California tell me about this place for weeks after she saw it on the Food Network, I was finally in the vicinity and able to check it out. \\n\\nIt's a very small place, Very Small. Cozy. \\n\\nLots to choose from on their chalkboard menu, we were greeted upon entry and told to come up and order when we were ready.\\n\\nWe ordered a ceaser salad, the Risotto Balls, Delicious balls of risotto with mozzarella cheese inside then lightly rolled in bread crumbs and fried with a side of marinara. Fresh Pasta Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken and Gnocchi with Tomato Cream Sauce.\\n\\nI thought the prices seemed a little high, but honeslty after tasting the food I didnt care.\\n\\nFirst of all everything came out piping HOT, including other diners dishes, you could see the steam rising throughout the restaurant!\\n\\nMy husband always orders Fettuccini Alfredo with Chicken and he said this was his Favorite and best he's ever had!\\n I had a few bites and  it was truly delicious with the fresh pasta and roasted pulled chicken and just the right amount of sauce, it had great flavor!\\n\\nMy Gnocchi was no exception, those tasty little morsels of cheesy mashed potatos if you will and the Tomato Cream sauce was excellent as well although I wish there had been just a tad more sauce.\\n\\nOur ceasar salad was large enough to share, fresh greens dressed just right but unfortunately no croutons or parmesean?\\n\\nThe bread and butter was really tasty too!\\n\\nAll in all, we had a great experience and would definitely return!\",\n",
       " u'I think this guy has let his 15 min of fame go to his head. Came here last week with a couple girlfriends for dinner,  The price we paid for just OK bland and flavorless food, cheep wine with a three times the price  price tag, and the luxury to sit on flimsy outdoor chairs, rolled in a napkin silverware and the best yet, plastic water cups was mind blowing. I felt like our waiter was up selling us the whole time and the hovering cocky owner was annoying at best. and lets talk about the \" As seen on food network\" sign hanging over the door and the diner guys pic hanging ever where, way overkill there. also what happened to a basket of free bread, come on $3 for bread are you kidding me. Whatever this place can suck it I wont be back.',\n",
       " u'All make this short and sweet, eatable but nothing great.  Prices too much for this over-hyped place.  Had the Giuseppe sub for lunch, alright but was wanting more stuff on the inside. Sandwich was overpowered by the bread.',\n",
       " u'I find these 5 star reviews to be incredibly suspicious. We just got back from returning our ***70 dollar take-out order*** (which consisted of 2 gnocchi, 1 bolognese, and 1 linguini and clam sauce, by the way) to a very rude and egotistical owner. We called beforehand to merely voice our concerns about this incredibly expensive, yet mediocre meal. The owner answered the phone and was not only unconcerned, but was very argumentative, saying that he \"only gets a complaint once every 2 months\" and that he has a \"packed house.\" He made us feel like our opinions didn\\'t matter in the least bit. He begrudgingly told us to bring our food back for a refund, so we did just that. When we arrived, he met us outside and argued with us a bit more, emphasizing that his 20 seat restaurant was full. When we tried to explain our concerns with the food, he said \"whatever\" and left, shortly returning with our refund.\\nFood:\\n-Clam and fettuccine-far too salty\\n-Tomato sauce- tastes like canned\\n-Gnocchi-mushy, no texture\\n-Bolognese-no flavor\\n\\nBottom line:\\n-Rude, arrogant owner\\n-Bland,over-priced food\\n-Never returning!!\\n\\nI really didn\\'t want to have to write this review, since I live in the neighborhood and want this place to be good. Before it appeared on Food Network, although expensive, this place was quite good. I just don\\'t want anyone else to waste their time and money when there are so many other good Italian restaurants to eat in Phoenix. (e.g. Aiello\\'s)',\n",
       " u\"Visited Giuseppe's while in Phoenix on a business trip. My bosses had heard about this restaurant from Diners Drive-In's and Dives. I was surprised that the restaurant was so small, but it was a comfy atmosphere. There were three of us and we shared the Chef's salad. It was VERY good! Definitely big enough to share and it was evenly proportioned with dressing. Could have eaten the whole thing by myself if I had a choice. I ordered the Pasta Alfredo-Limencello and it was alright, not the best. I ordered Tiramisu for dessert and it was AMAZING! Definitely worth ordering. Overall it was a very nice dinner and I would return if I'm ever in the area again.\",\n",
       " u'I have to say my visit today was a letdown. We had the risotto rice balls that were clearly not made fresh as the breaking was soggy and not crispy the way it should be. The meatballs were okay and slightly above average size, but $2 each?  Out pasta dinners were very good though. My carbonara was good as it usually is. My gf had a sausage with broccoli rabe that was good, but it could have done with a bit less oil. Considering the prices, I expected more. It has been a few months since I have been here and the prices seem to have gone up on several items.',\n",
       " u'Very high quality Italian food in a small, strip mall restaurant setting.   Handmade, fresh pasta: tagliatelle with bite and chewy cavatelli.  Bolognese ragu was excellent, wonderfully meaty and rich and without too much sauce or oil.   Delicious butternut ravioli and bruschetta.  (5/5 in quality for food)\\n\\nWild boar ragu was slightly too oily and salty for my taste.\\nSetting is a bit cramped for the high caliber of the food.\\n\\nThe owner is a symphony musician who studied cooking in Italy for 9 years, and his dedication to his craft shines through in his food (musicians are the biggest foodies:)).',\n",
       " u\"Anyone that give this restaurant less than 5 stars has no idea what they are talking about.  It is a restaurant that is for foodies.  It is NOT fancy, because that is not the point! Everything is made to ORDER and is fresh!  \\n\\nI have been here several times and think it is a fantastic spot.  Get to know the owner Richard. He is awesome. Tell him you like wine and he will pull something out that will surprise you.  Tell him you like good grappa and he will shock you!  \\n\\nIf you think the restaurant is crowded go home! This is a true little hole in the wall! \\n\\nIf you think the food is expensive, try and make home made Italian food on your own... Not happening cheaply! Oh, add a bottle of wine and guess what it gets even harder!  What is surprising is that Giuseppe's does NOT hit you for expensive wine.  Everything is reasonable. \\n\\nThis is a restaurant for people that love good food!\\n\\nEAT, DRINK, and enjoy!\",\n",
       " u'Flawless experience! Service was amazing, very friendly staff! Great lil mom and pop type feel to it. Food was out of this world. Very laid back atmosphere.. Nice surprise for a little hole in the wall Italian restaurant. The lasagna and veal meatballs were on point!',\n",
       " u\"After a bad experience with a friend several months ago (mostly our server,) I decided to try again a couple more times with a New Times deal. The food isn't bad, although a bit overpriced (a friend told me they raised their prices after being featured on DDD several years ago). The eggplant parmesan was good. The first time I went back, my server asked me after placing my salad and entree order if I would like some garlic bread. I said sure, thinking it would be complimentary as it often is at Italian places, and she said it casually enough to make it seem so. I do not recall seeing it on the menu. I got my bill and it was $4. I later noticed it was on the menu board which seems to be geared for their takeout customers. The second time I declined when she offered garlic bread again, and I even declined the basic bread and butter she offered me later because I wasn't sure how much it would cost! In my opinion, that would be like a Mexican restaurant offering you chips and salsa and then charging you for it. If I want to pay for it, I will order it. Given the offerings in the area with bar seating and similar, if not lower prices, I will probably not return any time soon.\",\n",
       " u'Best chicken parm in town.',\n",
       " u'Great food and service. Found this place on IDine and it was featured on triple D with guy. Small but have both in and outside tables.',\n",
       " u\"Well I held out on writing a review based off my 1st experience,  which was two weeks ago.  I called in a order to carry out.  I ordered shrimp fettuccine Alfredo with fig and marscopone purchtuo burchettas. When I got home it was terrible.  The pasta is home made so it's super thick.  Four small shrimp and hardly no Alfredo sauce, I mean dry. That fake bruccetta is hard and dry.  So I called a spoke to Cindy and explained that I lived far from the location.  It practically took me an hour to get there and I couldn't come back.  So she put the owner in the phone and we worked out a deal that I would get a $27.00 credit the next time I came in. \\n\\nFast forward to today which was a couple of weeks later. When I arrived Cindy wasn't there but the owner Richard was.  So I explained who I was and he remembered. So he said I can give you a $17.00 credit because you ate the meal didn't you?  I didn't even touch that dry mess. So being pressured and embarrassed of what the phone conversation was and what he was saying to my face and the place was packed and I didn't want to argue.  I just ordered their signature dish, the Osso buco to- go again. So the waiter rang me up and I ended up paying them about $15.00 additional dollars.  I was pissed off. But I figured well maybe it will be worth it.\\n\\nI get home and make nice salads for me and my husband to accompany the meal still with high hopes because it looks good and the meat is falling off the bone. So we eat it with disappointment.  The sauce is tasteless I mean no flavor at all the bread was dry.\\n\\nI will never return. I will go to Olive garden which I far better than this place. Or just wait to go back to New York and eat authentic Italian at Carmine's or Rao's in Vegas. Or for great bruccettas go to Postionos.\\n\\nI don't know why this place is crowded.  The food is bland and it's so tiny.  I have been to several DDD destinations this one is a BIG miss.\",\n",
       " u\"Well wanted to try some new Italian place today, so went to Giuseppe's on 28th we live a long way from here and was hoping it was good!!! Guess I was expecting to much, it was okay not great!!! Pasta is so thick, never had it like that and would have preferred it thinner! Server was very nice, polite and helpful! Too far to go a second time and try something else, so probably won't be returning!!! Where or where can you find a great Italian restaurant, have tried so many, the chain ones are better than any one of a kind and I'm tired of those????\",\n",
       " u\"That food is great!! I have had several dishes and they were all amazing, especially when comparing to other premium restaurants of the same type. \\n\\nService is very good. \\n\\nLocation is a little out of the way but in a very quaint spot. I love the interior and they have a great patio. \\n\\nThe only negative is that it is so far from my home... I'd like to visit it more often, but the distance will not stop me.\",\n",
       " u\"I've said on more than a few occasions that my meal of choice was the best tasting italian item Id ever tasted. I love the Alfredo dishes.... \\nAnd excellent chicken Marsala!\",\n",
       " u'Friendly, great food and great attitude.\\n\\nMy boss and a client went to L\\'Ampore and didn\\'t know what to expect.  What we received was excellent, friendly service and a great meal.  This quaint find was delightful and as we walked away, the words came out of our mouths, \"that is the way to run a restaurant\"!\\n\\nThe food: Each of us had a something different;  Gnocchi made with pesto (they don\\'t have it on the menu but the owner asked the staff if they could make it fresh.)   Ravioli with sweet Italian sausage and steak.  All were cooked to flavor and perfectly.  \\n\\nEven the wine was unique... \"If you see Kate\"... \\n\\nWhat a wonderful place with a great, take care of the customer attitude.  I will be back and I don\\'t live in Phoenix.',\n",
       " u'Very solid little Northern Italian restaurant on the outskirts of PV. Friendly, efficient servers, great entrees. My only problem was the appetizer mussels were tiny, but the other app (a grilled veggie platter) and all the entrees were great. A solid 4 stars.....',\n",
       " u'Cheap drink at happy hour and a free appetizer just for mentioning the Yelp ad. Great place to wet the whistle.',\n",
       " u'I usually just go on 99cent taco tuesdays.Cant beat it!',\n",
       " u\"This is easily one of the best if not THE BEST happy hour value in the Valley.  I hold Caffe Boa very highly in that regard too.\\n\\nI was a regular for McCormick and Schmick's happy hour in Downtown LA.  Since moving to Phoenix, I seem to forget it's even here, in it's hidden Esplanade office tower location.\\n\\nFive appetizers are $1.99 and another handful are $4.99.  Their claim to their happy hour fame is the 1/2 pound angus burger.  The Angus burger, which comes with steak fries, is decently sized and pretty good for $2 bucks.  Not the best burger I have ever had, but good considering the chump change you pay, it's a steal. Bobo and I splurged and ordered enough food for everyone in the bar, where you could just about hear a pin drop.  The calamari strips and grilled salmon cakes were pretty good too.  Bass and Hef on tap are $5 each.\\n\\nGranted we were also there at 9 pm for their reverse happy hour, (which is another added bonus) and watched as the last of the douchey corporate expense account 24th and Camelback crowd dwindled.\\n\\nService by the outgoing server Teresa was solid, and if you're even remotely in the area, I highly suggest it for some good cheap fun post-work.\\n\\nIf it wasn't for the happy hour it would probably be a three star place for the corporate seafood chainey feel.\",\n",
       " u\"I eat here at least once a week due to convenience and time, it's near my office. The service is uniformly excellent, the menu is basic but changes slightly almost daily and the prices are reasonable most of the time. They often have surprises at lunch on the specials menu and are very accommodating with changes, dietary restrictions and general fussiness that sometimes happens when everyone is on a diet. The GM Robin and Asst. Lise are a pleasure to deal with as well. Yes, it's a chain, and sometimes feels like it, but the beauty of chains is a dependable level or service and consistent value and food quality, they deliver on all three.\",\n",
